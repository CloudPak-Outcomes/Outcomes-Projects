    "# Spark Labs\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "Welcome to the Spark Labs Lab Guide! In this lab, we’ll walk through a hands-on scenario where you'll learn how to leverage Apache Spark to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load data efficiently\n",
    "- Save data into a table\n",
    "- Clean and preprocess data using Spark's parallel processing capabilities\n",
    "- Train a simple Logistic Regression classification model on the processed data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spark Labs Benefits:\n",
    "Before we dive into the lab, let’s take a moment to discuss the benefits of using Spark Labs with watsonx.data, especially in comparison to using external notebooks that connects to watsonx.data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  No Dependency Management:\n",
    "    - External Notebooks: When working in an external notebook, you'd typically run your code with the dependencies installed on your own computer. This can lead to version mismatches, dependency conflicts, or other setup challenges.\n",
    "    - watsonx.data: Since Spark Labs runs directly within the watsonx.data environment, you don’t need to worry about managing or troubleshooting dependencies. All the necessary packages and configurations are preconfigured on the server, ensuring consistency and saving you time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Easier Configuration:\n",
    "    - External Notebooks: Setting up an external environment often requires manual configuration, from installing the right versions of Spark and libraries to setting up paths and environment variables.\n",
    "    - watsonx.data: With watsonx.data, the environment is preconfigured for you. You can jump straight into coding without spending time on setup, making the process much faster and smoother.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Integrated Development Environment:\n",
    "    - External Notebooks: Using external notebooks can require managing different tools and platforms to run Spark, track results, and visualize data, which can be disjointed and time-consuming.\n",
    "    - watsonx.data: In this environment, everything you need is integrated into a single platform. You can manage your notebooks, run Spark jobs, and view results all in real time, without switching between different tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Easy Collaboration:\n",
    "   - External Notebooks: Collaboration can be cumbersome when working in local environments. Sharing notebooks may involve version control, syncing, or exporting and sending files manually.\n",
    "   - watsonx.data: With notebooks stored directly on the server, collaboration is seamless. You can easily share your work with colleagues and stakeholders, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and able to provide feedback in real-time."

    "## Spark Session Setup \n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Method (External Notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start using Apache Spark, we need to set up a Spark Session. This session is crucial as it acts as the entry point for all Spark functionality, allowing us to interact with Spark’s powerful distributed computing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In external environments, the setup typically involves configuring several options like the application name, cluster manager, memory allocation, and more. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "conf = SparkConf() \\\n",
    "    .setAppName(\"ComplexSparkSessionSetup\") \\\n",
    "    .setMaster(\"yarn\") \\  # Using YARN as the cluster manager\n",
    "    .set(\"spark.sql.warehouse.dir\", \"/user/hive/warehouse\") \\  # Custom warehouse location\n",
    "    .set(\"spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\", \"500\") \\  # Increase shuffle partitions for performance\n",
    "    .set(\"spark.executor.memory\", \"8g\") \\  # Allocate 8GB of memory to each executor\n",
    "    .set(\"spark.driver.memory\", \"4g\") \\  # Allocate 4GB of memory to the driver\n",
    "    .set(\"spark.executor.cores\", \"4\") \\  # 4 cores per executor\n",
    "    .set(\"spark.sql.parquet.compression.codec\", \"snappy\") \\  # Use Snappy compression for Parquet files\n",
    "    .set(\"spark.ui.port\", \"4041\")  # Change the Spark UI port to avoid conflicts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when running within watsonx.data, this extensive configuration is unnecessary because it is automatically setup, streamlining the setup processes, saving time and avoiding the need to sift through documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplified Setup for Watsonx.data (Spark Labs)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this current lab, the only configuration needed is the `fs.s3a.path.style.access` flag, which should be set to `true`. This is required because we're working with a `MinIO` bucket, and this flag ensures that Spark can properly access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Useful Flags:\n",
    "There are a few other configuration options that can help fine-tune your Spark session, especially for logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ae.spark.driver.log.level`: Sets the log level for the driver (e.g. `\"INFO\"`)\n",
    "- `ae.spark.executor.log.level`: Sets the log level for the executro (e.g. `\"INFO\"`)\n",
    "\n",
    "These flags are optional but can be helpful for debugging or performance tuning."

    "Watsonx.data follows a cascading architecture, structured in a hierarchical form: `Catalog` > `Schema` > `Table`. This topology helps organize the data in a way that is intuitive and easy to navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Catalog`: The top level in the architecture. Each Catalog contains multiple Schemas. It acts as a container for related datasets.\n",
    "- `Schema`: The middle level. A Schema organizes multiple Tables within a catalog. It serves as a namespace for tables, often reflecting logical groupings of data.\n",
    "- `Table`: The bottom level, where actual data resides. Each Table follows a specific schema definition and contains the data, often in a structured format such as rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax for working with the hierachy:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Watsonx.data, the hierarchy of `Catalogs`, `Schemas`, and `Tables` is accessed using `dot notation`. This makes it easy to specify and query data at various levels of the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you wanted to run queries on the Table `exampleTable` within the Schema `exampleSchema`, which is contained in the Catalog `exampleCatalog`, you would refer to it using the following syntax:\n",

    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Data quality is crucial for the success of AI models, and a major part of machine learning involves cleaning the data. While our dataset contains only around 1,000 rows, in real-world applications, datasets can contain trillions of rows or tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional data processing methods, such as using Hadoop, typically involve reading and writing data to disk. Each read and write operation takes significant computation time, and transformations are applied sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you had only 100MB of disk space but your dataset was 1GB (1,000MB), Hadoop would work as follows: it would load 100MB of data into memory, perform transformations, then load the next 100MB, and continue this process until the entire dataset has been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Value of Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark revolutionizes data processing by offering two key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In-Memory Computation:** Unlike Hadoop, which relies on disk storage, Spark loads data directly into memory. This approach is 10x to 100x faster since accessing memory is much quicker than reading from disk. This is especially advantageous for iterative algorithms, such as machine learning model training, which require repeated access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallelism:** To maximize efficiency, Spark is designed to process data in parallel across distributed systems (i.e., across many nodes in a cluster). By splitting the dataset into smaller partitions and performing operations on them simultaneously, Spark avoids the bottleneck of sequential processing. This parallel processing allows Spark to handle very large datasets that don't fit into a single machine's memory by distributing the workload across many machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these capabilities, Spark can process data much faster, saving both time and resources.\n",

While these values are numeric, they should not be treated as continuous numbers because they represent distinct categories. Unlike numerical features, where we might identify relationships (e.g., identifying a threshold for resting heart rate indicating potential heart disease), ordinal features should not have relationships inferred between the numbers themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the ordinal feature height with values `0`, `1`, and `2`, corresponding to `short`, `average`, and `tall`. It doesn't make sense to infer that the model should treat `0 (short)`, `1 (average)`, and `2 (tall)` as ordered numbers. Instead, we can represent this data using one-hot encoding, where each category is represented as a binary vector: `[1, 0, 0]` for short, `[0, 1, 0]` for average, and `[0, 0, 1]` for tall.
