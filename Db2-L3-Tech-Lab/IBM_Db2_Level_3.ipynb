    "# Introduction\n",
    "Data is the fuel that artificial intelligence (AI) engines run on. And databases often serve as the main repository for an organization's data. IBM has been a pioneer in data management technologies and advancements for decades. And a crucial part of this journey has been the invention of IBM Db2, a database built to address current data management needs, as well as provide an advantage as companies begin to incorporate AI into their workflows. Db2 databases are powered by AI to optimize and improve the data management process — AI-based features include a query optimizer that utilizes machine learning (ML), an adaptive workload manager that automatically adjusts concurrently running workloads to ensure the optimal number of queries are executed without compromising database stability, and built-in ML stored procedures that enable enterprises to learn from their data, at scale, without having to move it off-platform. Furthermore, Db2 is built <i><u>for</u></i> AI, ensuring users can effectively build AI models using popular programming languages like Python and R, as well as make them accessible through application programming interfaces (APIs) like representational state transfer (REST) APIs. All supported by enterprise-grade features like BLU Acceleration, massively parallel processing, and active compression, alongside robust security, highly available scalability (especially with pureScale technology), and disaster recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on lab is designed to do several things:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Introduce you to some of the basic objects you will find in almost every Db2 database, as well as show you how to create and delete them</li>\n",
    "    <li>Show you how to create and execute some simple <i>Structured Query Language</i> (SQL) statements that can be used to store, modify, retrieve, and delete data in a Db2 database</li>\n",
    "    <li>Introduce you to some advanced Db2 topics such as the Db2 Explain facility, user defined functions, and SQL procedures</li>\n",
    "    <li>Illustrate how to build Python applications that interact with a Db2 database, regardless of whether the database is on-premises (<b>created using IBM Db2 Community Edition</b>) or in the Cloud (<b>created under the Db2 \"Lite\" service on IBM Cloud</b>).\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "As you can see, this hands-on lab is provided in the form of a <b><i>Jupyter Notebook</i></b>. If you are unfamiliar with this technology, a Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that enables users to create and share documents that contain narrative text, live code, equations, and rich outputs such as graphical visualizations. (Jupyter Notebook is maintained by <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Project Jupyter</a>.) The name <i>Jupyter</i> comes from the core programming languages Jupyter Notebooks support: Julia, Python, and R. Jupyter ships with the IPython kernel, which enables users to write programs in Python, but there are currently over 100 other kernels that Jupyter Notebook supports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook framework contains several menu items and icons that enable users to interact with a notebook. The menu runs along the top of a Notebook just like menus do in other applications; the icons (buttons) are found just below the menu items. This introduction doesn't go into detail about each option available with every menu item. Instead, it will focus on just the two icons you will need to be familiar with to perform the exercises in this lab — these icons/buttons are emphasized in the following illustration:\n",

    "    </div></li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are multiple code cells in a Notebook (as there are in this Notebook) and you run the cells in order, imports (external modules that are loaded into an application for use) and variables can be shared across cells. This makes it easy to separate out code into logical chunks without needing to reimport libraries or recreate variables or functions in each cell. (That being said, you will see some variables get recreated in each code cell in this lab — that's done to both reset the variable and to draw your attention to the variables that are used for each operation.) \n",
    "\n",
    "When you select a code cell, you will notice that there are some square braces (<b>[ ]</b>) beside the word <b>In</b> located at the top and just to the left of the cell. As you work your way through the Notebook, the square braces will be filled with a number that indicates the order in which each cell was ran. For example, if you run the first code cell found at the top of a Notebook, the square braces will be filled with the number <b>1</b>. If you run the next code cell found after it, the square braces beside that cell will be filled with the number <b>2</b>, and so on. While a code cell is being executed, the square braces will be filled with an asterisk (<b>*</b>).\n",

    "While this hands-on lab is set up to be ran with the <b>Db2 \"Lite\" service</b> on IBM Cloud, this Jupyter Notebook can be used with <b>IBM Db2 Community Edition</b> as well. IBM Db2 Community Edition is a special no-charge, full featured version of Db2 that enables data professionals to develop and deploy applications using any of the features and functionality found in in the latest release of IBM Db2. There are no limits on how long IBM Db2 Community Edition can be used, and unlike with the Db2 \"Lite\" service on IBM Cloud, there are no limits on the size of databases that can be created. However, there are limits on the number of cores and amount of memory supported: IBM Db2 Community Edition can be used with up to four processor cores and no more than 16 gigabytes (GB) of random access memory (RAM). One advantage of using IBM Db2 Community Edition for this lab is that the exercises labeled \"<i>Optional</i> \" can be executed — with the Db2 \"Lite\" service</b> on IBM Cloud, the code for these exercises can be examined, but the code cells <b><i>cannot</i></b> be run.\n",

    "To download a copy of IBM Db2 Community Edition, simply go to the IBM Db2 web site (which can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/products/db2/database\">IBM Db2 Database</a>) and click on the “<b>Try it on premises →</b>” button shown on the page. After completing and submitting the form presented, you will be re-directed to the IBM Db2 Download Center web site. Once there, select the “<b>Download</b>” link that corresponds to the operating system you plan to install IBM Db2 Community Edition on. When the file has finished downloading, refer to the IBM Db2 documentation for instructions on how to install and configure the IBM Db2 Community Edition software. (Instructions for installing Db2 Version 11.5 can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=installing-db2-database-servers\">Db2 servers and IBM data server clients</a>.

    "## Step 2: Create a function that uses APIs in the <i>ibm_db</i> driver to execute SQL queries and retrieve/display query results\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "<b><i>Structured Query Language</i></b> (SQL) is a standardized language that is used to work with database objects and the data they contain. Using SQL, it's possible to define, alter, and delete database objects, as well as add data to, change data in, and retrieve or remove data from any objects created. Because SQL is non-procedural by design, it is not considered an actual programming language even though, like other programming languages, it has a defined syntax and its own set of language elements. Consequently, applications that utilize SQL are typically built by combining the decision and sequence control of a high-level programming language — in our case, Python — with the data storage, manipulation, and retrieval capabilities SQL provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL statements are frequently categorized according to the function they're designed to perform:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Embedded SQL Application Construct statements</b>: Used for the sole purpose of\n",
    "        constructing embedded SQL applications. (Applications written with the C programming language frequently use these statements.)</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Data Control Language (DCL) statements</b>: Used to grant and revoke authorities and privileges needed for Db2 instance management and data access.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Data Definition Language (DDL) statements</b>: Used to create, alter, and delete\n",
    "        database objects.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements</b>: Used to store data in,\n",
    "        modify data in, retrieve data from, and remove data from select database objects.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because many of the exercises found in this lab focus on constructing and executing DDL and DML statements, the database used will be queried often to ensure that operations desired are performed as expected. Rather than repeat the Python code needed to execute a query, retrieve the results, and display the information obtained <i><u>every time a query is executed</u></i>, the code in the following cell will encapsulate this work in a Python function that can be called whenever a query needs to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Python and Jupyter Notebook, application programming interfaces (APIs) in the <b>ibm_db</b> Python database interface driver are used to submit SQL statements to a Db2 database for processing, as well as retrieve results. The APIs used in the code in the following cell include: \n",

Each item in a tuple has a unique index value, starting with zero; an individual item in a tuple can be accessed by referencing its index value.</i>) Depending on how it is called, it can advance a cursor to the next row in a result set and copy the data for that row into a tuple. (<i>A cursor is an object that enables traversal over the rows of a result set.</i>) Or, it can be used to retrieve the data for a specific row — provided a keyset driven, dynamic, or static cursor is used to traverse the result set. In either case, the value for the first column in the row will be stored in the first position of the tuple (index position 0), the second column will be stored in the second position (index position 1) and so on.</td>\n",

    "Before operations can be performed against an IBM Db2 database, a connection to the database must first be established. To do this, you need information about the database environment such as the database's name or alias, the host name or IP address of the database server, and the port number Db2 uses for TCP/IP communications. You also need appropriate authorization credentials, which typically consist of a user or authentication ID and a corresponding password.

The storage representation of a row is called a <i>record</i>, the storage representation of a column is called a <i>field</i>, and each intersection of a row and column is referred to as a <i>value</i> (or <i>cell</i>).

Different cases are used here to visually separate user-supplied values (shown in lower case) from the regular syntax of the SQL statement shown (displayed in upper case). This format for examples is used throughout the exercises in this lab. That said, when looking for exact matches in queries (for example, <b>WHERE TABNAME = 'EMPLOYEES'</b>), user-supplied values must be provided in upper case because, by default, that is the way in which the value was stored. \n",

When objects that can be qualified by a schema are created, they are given a two-part name — the first (leftmost) part of the name is the <i>schema name</i> or <i>qualifier</i>, and the second (rightmost) part is the user-supplied object name. Syntactically, these two parts are concatenated and separated by a period (for example, <b>HR.EMPLOYEES</b>). When select database objects are created (for example, tables, views, indexes, user defined functions, and procedures), they are automatically assigned to a schema, based on the qualifier provided as part of the user-supplied name. The following illustration shows how a table named <b>EMPLOYEE</b> would be assigned to a schema named <b>HR</b> during the table creation process:\n",

    "&emsp; (deptno, deptname, mgrid)\n",
    "&emsp; VALUES ('A01', 'ADMINISTRATION', 1000)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the number of values provided in the <b>VALUES</b> clause must equal the number of column names identified in the column name list. The values provided will be assigned to columns in the order in which they appear — in other words, the first value listed will be assigned to the first column identified, the second value will be assigned to the second column identified, and so on. In addition, each value supplied must be compatible with the data type of the column it is being assigned to. (<i>For example, a character string value can only be assigned to a column that has character string data type.</i>)\n",
    "\n",
    "If values are provided for every column found in the table, the column name list can be omitted. In this case, the first value provided is assigned to the first column in the table, the second value is assigned to the second column, and so on. Thus, the record that was added to the <b>DEPARTMENT</b> table in the previous example could just as easily have been added by executing an <b>INSERT</b> statement that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>INSERT INTO department\n",
    "&emsp; VALUES ('A01', 'ADMINISTRATION', 1000)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with literal values, two special tokens can also be used to assign values to individual columns. The first token, <b>DEFAULT</b>, is used to assign a system- or user-supplied value to a column that was defined as having a default constraint when the table was created. The second, the <b>NULL</b> token, is used to assign a NULL value to any nullable column — that is, any column that was not defined as having a <b>NOT NULL</b> constraint. (<b>NULL</b> is the term used to represent a missing value in a relational database. It is neither the value 0 nor an empty string; instead, it acts as a representation of \"missing or inapplicable information.\")\n",

    "## Step 5: Add additional records to the EMPLOYEE table using a prepared INSERT statement with parameter markers\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "With Python and Jupyter Notebook (as well as many other programming languages), there are two ways in which SQL statements can be executed:<br>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Prepare and then execute</b>: This approach separates the preparation of an SQL statement from its actual execution and is typically used when a statement is to be executed repeatedly (often with different values being supplied for place holders in the statement with each execution). This method is also used when an application needs to know information about the columns that will exist in the result set produced by the statement, in advance. The <b>ibm_db.prepare( )</b> and <b>ibm_db.execute( )</b> application programming interfaces (APIs) in the <b>ibm_db</b> library are used to process SQL statements in this manner.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Execute immediately</b>: This approach combines the preparation and execution of an SQL statement into a single step and is typically used when a statement only needs to be executed once. The <b>ibm_db.exec_immediate( )</b> API in the <b>ibm_db</b> library is used to process SQL statements in this manner. (<i>This has been the approach used in the lab exercises thus far.</i>)</li>    \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "Both methodologies allow the use of <i>parameter markers</i> in place of constants or expressions in the SQL statements used; however, parameter markers are typically <i>not</i> used if the statement is only going to be executed once. Parameter markers are represented by question mark (<b>?</b>) characters and indicate positions in an SQL statement where the value of one or more variables is to be substituted at the time the statement is executed. If an application variable is associated with a specific parameter marker in an SQL statement, that variable is said to be “<i>bound</i>” to the parameter marker and such bindings can be made by executing the <b>ibm_db.bind_param( )</b> API. That said, with Python and Jupyter Notebook, application variables do not have to be explicitly bound in order to be used to provide values to parameter markers during SQL statement execution — values can be passed, via a Python tuple, when the <b>ibm_db.execute( )</b> or <b>ibm_db.exec_immediate( )</b> API is called. However, binding gives you more control over the parameter type (input, output, or input/output), SQL data type, precision, and scale that are used for the parameter marker values provided. (<i>To keep things simple, Python tuples will be used to provide values for parameter markers used throughout this lab.</i>)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Step 7: Create a view named EMP_DEPT\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "A <b><i>view</i></b> is a database object that is used to provide an alternative way of describing and displaying data stored in one or more tables. As with tables, views can be thought of as having columns and rows; unlike tables, views do not contain data. Instead, a view is essentially a named specification of a result table that is populated whenever the view is referenced. (Each time a view is referenced, a query is executed, and the results are retrieved from one or more underlying tables and returned in a table-like format.) The following illustration shows how a simple view that presents data from two different tables might look:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "   <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudPak-Outcomes/Outcomes-Projects/main/Db2-L3-Tech-Lab/View.png\" alt=\"View\" style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 50%;\"/>\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "   <i>Figure 3: A view that presents data stored in two different tables</i>\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because views look similar to tables, in most cases they can be referenced in the same way that tables can be referenced. That is, they can be the source of queries as well as the target of <b>INSERT</b>, <b>UPDATE</b>, and\n",
    "<b>DELETE</b> operations. (<i>We will take a closer look at the </i><b>UPDATE</b><i> and </i><b>DELETE</b><i> statements shortly.</i>) When a view is the target of such an operation, the query that was used to define the view is executed and the operation is performed on the results — the operation itself is actually executed against the base table(s) the view is derived from. (If a view is derived from other views, the operation cascades down through all applicable views until it reaches the appropriate table/tables.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that a single base table can serve as the source of multiple views; the SQL query provided as part of a view’s definition determines the data that is to be presented when the view is referenced. Because of this, views are sometimes used to control access to sensitive data. For example, if a table contains information about\n",
    "every employee who works for a company (including sensitive information like bank account numbers used for direct deposit), managers might access this table via a view that allows them to see only non-sensitive information about employees who report directly to them. Similarly, Human Resources personnel could be given access to the table by means of a view that lets them see only the information needed to generate employee paychecks. Because each set of users are given access to data through different views, they each see different presentations of data that resides in the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Views are created by executing the <b>CREATE VIEW</b> SQL statement. In its simplest form, the syntax for this statement looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>CREATE VIEW [ <i>ViewName</i> ]<br>\n",

    "## Step 10: Create the tables that are used by the Db2 Explain facility\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "When an SQL or XQuery statement is submitted to Db2 for processing, Db2's cost-based query optimizer analyzes it and generates several execution plans (known as <i>access plans</i>) that could potentially be used to perform the desired operation. It then estimates the execution cost of each plan and chooses the access plan that has the lowest anticipated cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a static SQL or XQuery statement is embedded in an application, the optimal access plan is chosen at precompile time (or at bind time if deferred binding is used), and an executable form of this plan is stored in the system catalog as an object known as a <i><b>package</b></i>. If however, a dynamic statement is constructed at application run time (which is the case with all of the SQL statements used in this lab), access plans are generated when the statement is prepared for execution and the access plan chosen is stored in memory, temporarily (in what is known as the <i>global package cache</i>).\n",
    "\n",
    "While Db2 provides several monitoring tools that can be used to obtain information about how well (or how poorly) some SQL operations perform, these tools cannot be used to examine the access plans that were chosen by the Db2 query optimizer. Enter the <b>Db2 Explain facility</b>. The Db2 Explain facility enables users to capture and display detailed information about the access plan that was chosen for a particular SQL or XQuery statement, together with performance information that can be used to identify poorly written statements and/or weaknesses in a database's design. More specifically, Explain data helps users understand exactly how Db2 accesses tables and indexes to get to data. (<i>We will take a closer look at indexes shortly.</i>)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the Db2 Explain facility can be utilized, a special set of tables known as <i>Explain tables</i> must first be created. Typically, Explain tables are created in \"development\" databases to aid in application design, but\n",
    "not in \"production\" databases, where application code remains fairly static. Consequently, Explain tables are\n",
    "not created with the system catalog tables and views during the database creation process. Instead, these tables must be created manually in the database that Explain operations will be performed against. Fortunately, the process of creating Explain tables is fairly straightforward; one way is by calling the <b>SYSPROC.SYSINSTALLOBJECTS( )</b> stored procedure. (<i>We will take a closer look at stored procedures a little later.</i>)\n",

By storing this information in the index (along with key values), the performance of some queries can be greatly improved. That's because if all the data needed to resolve a query can be obtained by accessing the index only, data does not have to be retrieved from the associated table. (If the data needed to resolve a query does not reside solely in an index, both the index and the associated table must be accessed.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the <b>UNIQUE</b> clause is specified with the <b>CREATE INDEX</b> statement used, the resulting index will be a unique index that will be used to ensure the associated table does not contain duplicate occurrences of the same values in the columns that make up the index key. If the table the index is to be created for already contains\n",
    "data, uniqueness is checked and enforced at the time Db2 attempts to create the index, and if records with duplicate index key values are found, the index will not be created. On the other hand, if no duplicates exist, the index will be created and uniqueness will be enforced when <b>INSERT</b> and <b>UPDATE</b> operations are performed against the associated table. (Any time that the uniqueness of the index key is compromised, the insert or update operation will fail and an error will be generated.)\n",

    "Thus, to create an index named <b>EMPNO_IDX</b> for a table named <b>EMPLOYEES</b> whose key consists of a column named <b>EMPNO</b> and that includes data from a column named <b>LASTNAME</b>, you would execute a <b>CREATE INDEX</b> statement that looks something like this:\n",

    "A single table can contain a significant number of indexes; however, every index comes at a price. Because indexes store key column and row pointer data, additional storage space is needed for every index used. Furthermore, write performance is negatively affected — each time an <b>INSERT</b>, <b>UPDATE</b>, or <b>DELETE</b> operation is performed against a table with indexes, every table affected must be updated as well to reflect the changes made. Therefore, indexes should be created only when there is a clear performance advantage to having them available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes are typically used to improve query performance. So, tables that are used for data mining, business intelligence, data warehousing, and by applications that execute many (and often complex) queries but rarely modify data are prime candidates for indexes.

    "## Step 14: Roll back and commit a transaction\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "A <b><i>transaction</i></b> (also known as a <i>unit of work</i>) is a sequence of one or more SQL operations that are grouped together as a single unit, usually within an application process. Such units are considered atomic (from the Greek word meaning “not able to be cut”) because they are indivisible — either all of a transaction’s work is carried out, or none of its work is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "A given transaction can perform any number of SQL operations, depending upon what is considered a single step within a company’s business logic. With that said, it is important to note that the longer a transaction is — that is, the more SQL operations a transaction performs — the more problematic it can be to manage. This is especially true if multiple transactions must run concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initiation and termination of a single transaction defines points of consistency within a Db2 database. Consequently, either the effects of all operations performed within a transaction are applied to the database and made permanent (i.e. <i>committed</i>), or they are backed out (<i>rolled back</i>) and the database is returned to the state it was in immediately before the transaction was started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, a transaction is initiated the first time an SQL statement is executed after a connection to a database has been established, or when an SQL statement is executed after a running transaction has ended. Once started, transactions can be implicitly committed using a feature known as </i>automatic commit</i> (in which case, each executable SQL statement is treated as a single transaction, and changes made by that statement are automatically applied to the database unless the statement fails to execute successfully). Or, they can be explicitly terminated by executing either the <b>COMMIT</b> or the <b>ROLLBACK</b> SQL statement. The basic syntax for these two statements is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>COMMIT &lt; WORK &gt;</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>ROLLBACK &lt; WORK &gt;</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "When the <b>COMMIT</b> statement is used to terminate a transaction, all changes made to the database since the transaction began are made permanent. When the <b>ROLLBACK</b> statement is used instead, all changes made are backed out, and the database is returned to the state it was in just before the transaction was started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncommitted changes made by a transaction are usually inaccessible to other users and applications (there are exceptions) and can be backed out at any time. However, once a transaction’s changes have been committed, they become accessible to <i><u>all</u></i> users and applications and the only way to remove the changes made is by performing an <b>UPDATE</b> or <b>DELETE</b> operation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "With Python and Jupyter Notebook, the <b>ibm_db.commit( )</b> and <b>ibm_db.rollback( )</b> application programming interfaces (APIs) in the <b>ibm_db</b> library can be used to terminate transactions. These APIs eliminate the need to prepare and execute <b>COMMIT</b> and/or <b>ROLLBACK</b> SQL statements. In addition, the <b>ibm_db.autocommit( )</b> API can be used to determine if automatic commit behavior is enabled or disabled, as well as turn this behavior <b>ON</b> or <b>OFF</b>.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Execute the code:\n",
    "The code in the next cell executes the <b>ibm_db.autocommit( )</b> API to determine whether automatic commit behavior is <b>ON</b> or <b>OFF</b> — if this behavior is <b>ON</b>, the <b>ibm_db.autocommit( )</b> API is executed again to turn it <b>OFF</b>. Then, the code builds and executes an <b>INSERT</b> statement that adds a record to the <b>EMPLOYEE</b> table created earlier and queries the table to verify the record was added — it can see the record because it owns the transaction that performed the <b>INSERT</b> operation. However, in most cases (there are exceptions), other applications will <b>NOT</b> be able to see the record until the transaction is committed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "After verifying the record was added, the code executes the <b>ibm_db.rollback( )</b> API to back out the change made by the <b>INSERT</b> operation (transaction). Then, it queries the <b>EMPLOYEE</b> table again to confirm the record no longer exists. Next, it executes the <b>INSERT</b> statement once more and executes the <b>ibm_db.commit( )</b> API to end the transaction and make the change permanent. Then, it queries the <b>EMPLOYEE</b> table again to verify the record exists. Finally, it executes the <b>ibm_db.autocommit( )</b> API once more to turn automatic commit behavior <b>ON</b>.\n",

    "## Step 1: Create two user defined functions\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "<b><i>User defined functions (UDFs)</i></b> are special objects that can be used to extend and enhance the support provided by the built-in functions available with Db2. But, unlike built-in functions, UDFs can take advantage of operating system calls and the Db2 administrative application programming interfaces (APIs) Db2 provides. Several different types of UDFs can be created:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>SQL scalar</b>: A function whose body is written entirely in SQL and Db2 SQL Procedural Language (SQL PL) that returns a single value each time it is called. (SQL PL is a language extension of SQL that consists of statements and language elements that can be used to implement procedural logic in user defined functions and stored procedures. <i>You can learn more about SQL PL here:</i> <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=data-sql-pl-support\">SQL Procedural Language (SQL PL)</a>.)</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>SQL table</b>: A function whose body is written entirely in SQL and SQL PL that returns a result set, in the form of a table, each time it is called.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Sourced (or Template)</b>: A function that is based on another function (referred to as\n",
    "the <i>source function</i>) that already exists. Sourced functions can be columnar, scalar, or tabular in nature; they can also be designed to overload specific operators such as <b>+</b>, <b>–</b>, <b>*</b>, and <b>/</b>. When a sourced function is invoked, all arguments passed to it are converted to the data types the underlying source function expects, and the source function itself is executed. Upon completion, the source function performs any conversions necessary on the results produced and then returns them to the calling application.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>External scalar</b>: A function whose body is written in a high-level programming language like C, C++, or Java that returns a single value each time it is called. The function itself resides in an external library and is registered in the database, along with any related attributes.</li>   \n",
    "    <li><b>External table</b>: A function whose body is written in a high-level programming language that returns a result set, in the form of a table, each time it is called. As with external scalar functions, the function itself resides in an external library and is registered in the database, along with any related attributes.</li>\n",
    "     <li><b>OLE DB External Table</b>: A function whose body is written in a high-level programming language that can access data from an Object Linking and Embedding Database (OLE DB) provider and return a result set in the form of a table.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a UDF is created (and registered with a database), it can be used anywhere a comparable built-in function can be used — UDFs are created (and registered with a database) using the <b>CREATE FUNCTION</b> SQL statement. Several forms of this statement are available; the appropriate form to use is determined by the function type desired. The basic syntax for the form of this statement that is used to create an SQL scalar function is:\n",

    "&emsp;RETURN [ <i>ReturnStatement</i> ]</b>\n",

    "### Overview:\n",
    "The way in which a user defined function (UDF) can be used is largely dependent upon the function type. A scalar function optionally accepts arguments and returns a single scalar value each time the function is called. Therefore, and SQL scalar function can be used wherever an <i>expression</i> can be used. (An expression is a specification, which can include operators, operands, and parentheses, that a Db2 database can evaluate to one or more values, or to a reference to some database object.)\n",

    "## Step 3: Create an SQL procedure\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Every time an SQL statement is executed against a Db2 database that resides on a remote server, the statement itself is sent over a network to the server for processing. The database at the server then executes the statement and returns the results, again over the network, to the appropriate user/application. This means that two messages must travel over the network for every SQL statement that gets executed. By breaking monolithic applications into separate parts and storing those parts that perform a relatively large amount of database activity with little or no user interaction directly on the database server itself (in the form of a <i>stored procedure</i>), the amount of data that needs to flow across the network can be greatly reduced. In some cases, this approach can also enhance application performance, since the portions of the code that interact with the database are physically stored on the server where computing power and centralized control can deliver quick, coordinated data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><i>Stored procedures</i></b> allow work that is done against a database to be encapsulated and stored in\n",
    "such a way that it can be executed directly at the database server by any application or user who has the appropriate authority. And, because only one SQL statement is needed to invoke a stored procedure (the <b>CALL</b> statement), fewer messages are transmitted across the network — only the data that is actually needed at the client is sent across. It is also important to note that when a stored procedure is used to implement a specific business rule, the logic needed to apply that rule can be incorporated into <i><u>any</u></i> application simply by invoking the procedure. Thus, the same business rule logic is guaranteed to be enforced across multiple applications. And if business rules change, only the logic in the procedure has to be modified — applications that call the procedure do not have to be altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two different types of stored procedures can be created:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>SQL (or Native SQL)</b>: A stored procedure whose body is written entirely in SQL or SQL Procedural Language (SQL PL). (SQL PL is a language extension of SQL that consists of statements and language elements that can be used to implement procedural logic in user defined functions and stored procedures. <i>You can learn more about SQL PL here:</i> <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=data-sql-pl-support\">SQL Procedural Language (SQL PL)</a>.)</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>External</b>: A stored procedure whose body is written in a high-level programming language such as C, C++, COBOL, Java, or REXX that resides in an external library that is accessible to DB2; external stored procedures must be registered in a database, along with all their related attributes, before they can be invoked.</li>\n",
    "</ul>    \n",
    "   \n",
    "While SQL procedures offer rapid application development and considerable flexibility, external stored procedures can be much more powerful because they can exploit system calls and the administrative application programming interfaces (APIs) that are provided with Db2. However, this increase in functionality makes them much more difficult to produce. In fact, the following steps are required to create an external stored procedure:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Construct the body of the procedure, using a supported high-level programming language.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Compile and link the procedure to create a shared (dynamic-link) library.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Debug the procedure, repeating steps 1 and 2 until all problems have been resolved.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Physically store the library containing the procedure on the database server.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Modify system permissions for the library so that all users with the proper authority can execute it.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Register the procedure with the appropriate Db2 database (running on the server).</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of whether stored procedures are written using SQL or a high-level programming language, they must perform the following tasks, in the order shown:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Accept any input parameter values the calling application supplies.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Perform whatever processing is appropriate (typically, this involves executing one or more SQL statements as a single operation).</li>\n",
    "    <li>Return output data (if data is to be returned) to the calling application — at a minimum, a stored procedure should return a value that indicates whether it executed successfully.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "Stored procedures are created by executing the <b>CREATE PROCEDURE</b> statement. Two forms of this statement are available, and the appropriate form to use is determined by the stored procedure type. The basic syntax for the form of the <b>CREATE PROCEDURE</b> statement that is used to create an SQL stored procedure looks something like this:\n",

    "While it is important to be able to create and modify database objects in a Db2 database, it is equally important to be able to delete objects when they are no longer needed. Most user-defined objects can be removed from a Db2 database by executing some form of the <b>DROP</b> SQL statement. The basic syntax for this statement is:\n",

    "## Step 5: Terminate the database connection\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "When a database connection is established, it remains in effect until it is explicitly terminated or until the application that established the connection ends. That said, it is good programming practice to explicitly terminate any database connections that are open before ending an application returning control to the operating system. While this is typically done as part of the \"exit and cleanup\" work of an application, it can also be done any time an error is raised that forces an application to terminate prematurely.\n",
