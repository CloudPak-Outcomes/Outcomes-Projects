This step improves data quality and discoverability.\n","\n","4. **Publishing Enriched Data Assets**: Once enriched, we will publish these data assets back to our catalog. This makes them readily available for creating data products and ensures that the enriched information is accessible for future use.\n","\n","By using the helper script to automate these steps, we can significantly reduce the setup time, allowing us to focus on more advanced aspects of the lab. \n","\n",">**&#10032;** **Note:** The helper script is a Python script that uses the Watson Data API to automate the tasks outlined above. It is imperative that the participant ensures that the **correct environment variables are entered** to enable the script to perform these tasks efficiently. This approach lays a solid foundation for creating a data product, ensuring that all necessary assets are prepared and optimized for efficient use.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bde2930b-917a-4590-946e-b090987366c7"},"source":["### Set Environment
