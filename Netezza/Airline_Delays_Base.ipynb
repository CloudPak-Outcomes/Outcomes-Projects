Due to awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic as a possible distruptor for the flight delay data, the flight delay data was normalized to compare distrupted flight ratios across all three years and this analysis found that 2022 was trending with an increase in delays. \n",
    "Next, there were several queries performed to compare delay trends from the historical periods 2003-2012 and 2013-2018. By taking the average delays per month, the analysis showed that flight delays were descreasing in the late 2010s (2012-2018). \n",
    "Recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and other global factors did impact flight delays when looking at 2022 flight data compared to pre-pandemic flight delay trends, as there has been a definite increase in flight delays during 2022. \n",
    "Lastly, this data analysis included information about airports and air carriers that were operating flights between 2003 and 2022. The final queries were able to determine which air carriers operate with the least amount of flight delays and which majory aiports encounter the most flight delays. This allows a recomendation to be provided to travelers on which air carriers to fly and which airports to use. \n",
