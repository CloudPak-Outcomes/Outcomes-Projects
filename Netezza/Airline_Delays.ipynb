    "Global Travel Associates (GTA) has been receiving feedback from their air travel clients within the United States concerning the increase in flight delays during the return to travel in 2023 after the pandemic. GTA has learned that the U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics has a data set available that contains flight delay information for the United States from 2003 through June 2023. GTA will perform analysis on this data using a Jupyter notebook to determine if:\n",
    "(1) flight delays have increased in 2023 over prior years as their customers claim, and \n",
    "(2) arrive at a list of airlines and airports that can be recommended to their customers where flight delays are at a minimum (to reduce the chances of their customers encountering a flight delay).\n",
    "\n",
    "GTA wants to keep the costs of this analysis to a minimum, so the current data (2019 through April 2023) will be stored in a fully managed Netezza Performance Server as a Service (NPSaaS) database on Microsoft Azure and the historical data (2003 through 2018) will be stored in a Parquet format file on AWS S3 storage (low cost, resilient cloud storage) to reduce the overall cost of the data analysis effort."

Although 2020 was not a great year to travel due to COVID-19, of the flights that did operate, the overall chance of a flight delay was relatively low compared to prior years. 2023 looked as though it had a low quantity of flight delays. However, when analyzing the amount of flight delays compared to the total number of flights scheduled, it is clear that 2023 has not been performing well. To date, 2023 has the highest percentage of distrupted flights overall. \n",

    "The data analysis for flight delay data is now complete. To review, the initial analysis was based on current flight delay data from 2019 through April 2023. Due to awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic as a possible distruptor for the flight delay data, the flight delay data was normalized to compare distrupted flight ratios across all three years and this analysis found that 2023 was trending with an increase in delays. Next, there were several queries performed to compare delay trends from the historical periods 2003-2012 and 2013-2018. By taking the average delays per month, the analysis showed that flight delays were decreasing in the late 2010s (2012-2018). Recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and other global factors did impact flight delays when looking at 2023 flight data compared to pre-pandemic flight delay trends, as there has been a definite increase in flight delays during 2023. Lastly, this data analysis included information about airports and air carriers that were operating flights between 2003 and 2023. The final queries were able to determine which air carriers operate with the least amount of flight delays and which major aiports encounter the most flight delays. This allows a recomendation to be provided to travelers on which air carriers to fly and which airports to use. "
