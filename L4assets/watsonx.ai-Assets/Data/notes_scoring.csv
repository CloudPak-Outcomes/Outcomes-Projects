1,"I am writing you this statement to delete the following information on my credit report. The items I need deleted are listed in the report. I am a victim of identity thief, I demand that you remove these errors to correct my report immediately! I have reported this to the federal trade commission and have attached the federal trade commission affidavit. Now that I have given you the following information, please correct my credit report or I shall proceed with involving my attorney!"
2,"On XX/XX/2023, I entered a Bank of America Branch office to deposit my check. I asked the teller that approved and processed my deposit If the check could be manually verified before deposit so there would be no issues with holds as I am already adhering to the five business day policy that Bank of America requires ; she agreed and verified validity and funds of the check, processed transaction and provided me the receipt attached with the dates that funds would be available. The next day I called the bank of Americas customer service number because upon checking my account, I noticed that the check balance was no longer on hold, but the funds were reversed, so it looked as if I had never deposited the check. After waiting and speaking to 3 different managers, they updated the account to show a pending debit of funds instead of a reversal. They informed me that the check had been placed with an extra hold for an unspecified amount of time, even though the funds had been verified. The collection had begun because the issuing bank "" could try and collect it back '' I explained this was a settlement check from another significant bank. Even after being verified, I needed clarification on why this would be an issue and have yet to receive one. I decided to wait until XX/XX/2023, to verify if my partial release of funds was available, and it was not ; on XX/XX/2023, I called Bank of America and spoke to three managers via the Nevada office. They stated I only needed their first names as they are the only ones that work there. The call started with XXXX, who said that there would no longer be a partial release of funds due to the extended hold of the check ; she also verified at my request that the check had been verified and collected, but because this amount had not been deposited in my account before they would need additional time to ensure the check validity. I informed XXXX this was not the first time I had received a large check and that this was discriminatory behavior, and she insisted that it was not ; I then asked why none of this information was provided to me in writing and why I had to call to find out the updates on what was happening with my funds. She stated because these decisions were made at night and there wasn't time to inform me. I noted to her that my receipt from the teller with the release dates and funds availability was the only documentation I had been provided, and by that, they were in breach of their agreement with me at this time for this deposit. She told me she could only offer me a line of credit with them. She asked precisely why I needed the funds immediately ; I informed her I had children to feed, and she suggested I ask a friend for money. I was highly offended and asked to speak to her Manager, XXXX, and for another XXXX minutes, I talked to XXXX, who insisted on the two same options. Get a credit line or borrow money from a friend. After this frustrating and humiliating conversation, I asked to speak to XXXX 's manager and was transferred to XXXX, who stated she would review the account and give me a callback. I received a callback from XXXX at XXXX pm that same day. She proceeded to explain they were not going to release any funds to me and did not provide a reason but offered to give me a {$500.00} counter credit that I would need to go to the atm and pull out immediately before it wasn't available again so that I could use to funds for food for my children. I asked her who came up with that amount and why I was being offered a credit when I had a receipt showing I should have funds available. XXXX explained that was the best she could do, I stated that this was mishandled entirely and I would be submitting a complaint against all 3 of them, and XXXX explained that if I proceeded with a complaint, I would forfeit the XXXX credit. I agreed to forfeit the credit as I should have been given my funds since they breached the agreement with the receipt they provided. I also believe it is unfair to be forced into another consumer product from them ( a line of credit ) to have access to my funds. It is XX/XX/2023, when my total funds should be available, and my account balance is still negative."
3,"Folks, I am in XXXX XXXX. I was living and working in the US quite a while ago and had some monies in Bank of America. I was always able to log in via internet and see my account and check the balance. In XX/XX/2022 the debit card issued to me expired and I duly requested another card to be sent to me. I had always made sure that my contact details were updated. No new card was sent out and no contact was made. The bank 's 2 factor authentication made it impossible for me to access my account from XXXX simply because I did not have a US  mobile and BofA could not accept international mobile numbers. I was told by BofA that I needed a XXXX  USB cryptographic key to be able to access my account and to be able to make wire transfers. I was forced against my will to actually purchase a USB key ( for XXXX ) so that I can regain access to internet banking. Once I had access, I tried making a wire transfer through internet banking with the assistance of BofA staff. 
That transaction was then cancelled by BofA. I have since tried to communicate and make a phone appointment but all I got was empty promises of contact. I can not access my money of {$5300.00} nor can I close my account. Please help"
4,"On XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted on my cellphone by Radius Global Solutions, a debt collection agency ( https : //www.radiusgs.com ). I ignored the calls. I was again contacted via cell phone today at XXXXXXXX XXXX from ( XXXX ) XXXX. I ignored this as well. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a certified cease and desist letter to address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MN XXXX with tracking number XXXX which was "" delivered to final agent for final delivery '' on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX per return receipt. 

They have been ordered to stop and yet they continue to call."
5,"I placed an order for a product with Best Buy on XX/XX/XXXX, using my Best Buy Credit Card for payment ( {$1200.00} ). The order was to be delivered XXXX via XXXX. The order was never delivered. Best Buy retailer was contacted via support chat on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX : refuses to re-ship the order or issue a credit. XXXX tracking info indicates the order was signed for, but the signature is not my name ( and I live alone ). I considered XXXX  at fault and filed a complaint with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( called virtual BOT XX/XX/XXXX ; spoke to live rep XX/XX/XXXX ; response email to XXXX complaint received on XX/XX/XXXX ) is adamant that Best Buy retailer needs to file a claim to resolve the issue, but Best Buy retailer refuses to do so. I called Best Buy Credit Card Support on XXXX to file a dispute : they are telling me it can take 60-90 days to reach a resolution. I find this very unacceptable and frustrating b/c I suspect XXXX messed up ( either delivered to wrong address & person, or driver kept the order ) but refuses to take blame, but more importantly Best Buy retailer and Credit Card refuses to support a long-time customer and makes me feel like I am not worth the time and effort to resolve the matter promptly."
6,Last week there was approximately {$140.00} withdrawn by ACH. I contacted the bank as this was not authorized. I did not sign up or give anyone my account information. I was told this also occurred two times prior. This is FRAUD. The bank refunded one of three fraudulent withdrawals and refuses to refund approximately {$300.00} they allowed to be removed without any signed consent or any authorization by me.

Upon speaking to aylissa she proceeded to tell me that if I had not brought a payment in she was going have my car repo.

8,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Bank of America stating an account was opened in my name. I contacted them as soon as I woke up and saw the email regarding the fraudulent account. I was told that it was closed and that was it. I received an email about a week later entitled Check Fraud and Digital Claims and the email looked suspicious asking me to send a copy of my social security card, social security statement, my identification, mortgage/lease statement and other personal information. I co tasted Bank of America and after 2 hours was not able to resolve this issue. They don't want to confirm if the account is closed and are acting like they can't tell me if there has been activity on this account that was opened in my name. They won't answer how or why an account could be opened in my name without them verifying my information or receiving a deposit. I would like to file a complaint on Bank of America because this business practice is not fair to consumers. I have a block on my credit and now a block on XXXX. I feel like they are not doing their due diligence to protect consumers from fraud."

10,"Dear Wakefield and Associates, I am writing in regards to a collection listed on my XXXX credit report. The collection is dated XX/XX/2020 and is for XXXX I am disputing this collection. I have not made any payments on this debt and do not recognize it as mine. I was not aware of this debt until I recently reviewed my credit report. 

I am asking that you verify the accuracy of this collection and provide supporting documentation to validate the debt. If I do not receive a response within 30 days, I will consider this debt as invalid and request that XXXX delete it from my credit report. 

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
11,"Since XX/XX/2023, Westlake financial has been calling several times a day and more than 7 times within one week. They repossessed my car and provided misleading and inaccurate information about the process. My car was repossessed when my payment was 54 days last due ; however, I was informed during a prior call that it would not occur until 60 days past due. When Ive tried to communicate with a representative, I was told I was lying. They cut me off, spoke over me, and addressed me in a belittling manner."
12,"Hi my name is XXXX XXXX, and I signed up for Synchrony bank through Amazon to make a purchase of {$88.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and was never issued a credit card by mail. Without the card I was unable to sign into my account with Synchrony bank which ended in XXXX. I was unable to log on to my account until yesterday, XX/XX/2023 and I paid off my debt. My credit score went down and my Synchrony account shows that I made the payment but they are still demanding {$44.00} and saying that my account is delinquent. I have been getting harassment calls every single day since XXXX about making a payment and still got a call this morning even though my payment was processed."
13,"In XXXX, XXXX, I requested a refund of payments made during the XXXX forbearance from my servicer XXXX that the company never filed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted my current servicer, Mohela, for a refund. I filed CFPB complaint # XXXX on XXXX and on XXXX, Mohela sent a letter stating that it had been sent to the Treasury for XXXX and that I would receive a check within 30 days. On XXXX, my student loan balance went up reflecting the refunded amount being applied back to my account. 

It's XXXX, and I still have not received a check. I finally reached out to my XXXX who contacted the Department of Treasury for me to check on the status. The response to their office was that Treasury had not received the request ( language copied from email ) : When a payment does not appear in XXXX, it means payment instructions have not yet been transmitted to XXXX. The forbearance payment promised by Mohela is still with Mohela or whatever agency would transmit the payment instructions to XXXX. You will need to redirect this inquiry to determine when payment instructions will be transmitted to XXXX. 

I can not get an answer from Mohela has to how long it takes Treasury to receive information to issue a check but 2 months seems excessive. It appears that the problem is on Mohela 's end, not on Treasury 's."
14,"I called midland to discuss the debt, they cant pull-up debts information using my phone number, when gave them my number they asked me if Im someone else, I think this midland account is not belong to my name"
15,"On XX/XX/XXXX I applied for a HELOC with United Wholesale Mortgage in the amount of {$110000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I closed on that HELOC and provided instructions that I wanted an initial advance in the amount of {$60000.00}. 

{$60000.00} was deposited into my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I received my first statement, dated XX/XX/XXXX, from UWM which states the outstanding principal balance of my HELOC is {$110000.00}. Puzzled, I reached out to UWM and asked them why my statement suggests that I had accessed/used the entire balance of my HELOC. The customer service agent I spoke with was unable to locate my closing documents and suggested that the remaining balance of the HELOC was likely used to pay off other creditors. This did not happen. I did not ask for my other debts to be paid off they have not been paid off. And I did not/have not taken any additional draws on the HELOC. I was informed I can submit a qualified written request challenging the accuracy of the outstanding principal balance. 

In the closing documents I was provided a copy of, the settlement statement shows the following : Loan amount = {$110000.00} Total of Origination Costs = ( {$5300.00} ) Due to Borrower = ( {$60000.00} ) HELOC Balance = {$47000.00} Id like UWM to provide me with a register of activity associated with my HELOC so I can understand where the remaining {$47000.00} was allocated. If there is other disbursements from my account these were either incorrectly applied to my account or they are fraudulent transactions. 

My current loan payment, due XX/XX/XXXX, is {$860.00}. This was calculated using interest applied to the incorrect and overstated outstanding balance of the loan. Id like this and subsequent payments to be corrected to accurately reflect my outstanding principal balance of {$60000.00}."

17,"Wakefield and associates is listing an account on my credit reports. I disputed the debt. The creditor and/or credit reporting agency stated the account meets FCRA requirements XXXX 

However, this collection agency has failed to meet FCRA requirements. Im asking that the collection agency provide me with the original contract, payment history, and proof of ownership of this debt. I have never heard of Wakefield and associates. I have no contract to do business with them at all. 
I have been denied housing. This account is harming my ability to secure suitable housing for my family at this time."
18,"I received a communication from Venmo that I was approved for a credit card on XX/XX/XXXX, but I never applied for the card. I then received an email that I was being shipped a Venmo credit card from Synchrony bank ( XX/XX/XXXX ). My Venmo account does not have a shipping/billing address associated with it, but I do have other cards through Synchrony. I believe that Venmo/Synchrony opened the account against my will and used my shipping information associated with my other accounts in order to send me a card to meet their quota ( the hallmarks of my case are very similar to that of the XXXX XXXX offense several years ago ). I called and was able to close the account so that the card can not be used when it arrives, but I do believe that the strike against my credit score was done without my consent."
19,"I decided to switch fromXXXX to another carrier. In order to do that and keep my same phones, it was required to pay off remaining balance which were the cost of the phones and monthly phone bill. Two payments were provide to complete this before they would unlock the phones to allow the new carrier to activate them. The first payment was for {$440.00} paid on XX/XX/2022 at XXXX XXXX. The phones still wouldn't activate which lead me to call back to be told there was still a balance that needed to be paid and the second payment was {$180.00} on XX/XX/2022 paid at XXXX XXXX. I talked to three people who advised that all balances were now paid and the account was successful closed and phones will now be able to be unlocked for the new carrier. All of a sudden I receive a XXXX point decrease across all three credit reporting for collections from XXXX XXXX  to collect {$460.00} for the cost of the phones! Ultimately they deleted and the law office closed the account after proof was sent and now sent to another company, Credence Resource Management for the same amount. I have spoken with XXXX XXXX again who stated they opened investigation because they can only find the {$180.00} payment and will call me in 5 days and that was over 30 days ago. I called the collection company and they keep saying pay. I was in the middle of buying a house and this stopped me causing devastation to my family! I want this DELETED for all three reports NOW!"
20,"I can't reach a supervisor to discuss issues with my PSLF forgiveness. Mohela shows my forgiveness only going back to XX/XX/XXXX when it should go back to XX/XX/XXXX. This has caused my PSLF payment count to only go from XXXX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. My loan has been forgiven but if my payments were properly accounted for, forgiveness should be from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. That would mean any payments after XXXX would be refunded. 

I've tried calling Mohela several times to discuss this with them but whenever I contact them and get transferred to a supervisor I either get disconnected or wait on hold for hours and no one picks up."
21,"I was charged {$620.00} on XXXX XXXX and I did not authorize this charge. I immediately called Citibank to rectify the situation and they gave me a provisional credit. I had never been to this establishment or heard of it. I got a new card in the mail. Today, on XX/XX/XXXX, I went to deposit money into my account to pay my wifi bill, and it was negative XXXX dollars. I was shocked. It said that the charge was reversed in favor of the business. However, Ive never been here and Id like to see the proof that I was here and paid for this. Im currently pregnant and unemployed and this is proving to be a severe hardship for me that I cant pay bills on this account. I have only ever filed one dispute before this and that was back in XXXX XXXX XXXX, so this is not a common occurrence for me to file disputes. I would just like my money back as it is mine."

I've managed to contact Phoenix Financial Services, LLC over the phone and asked to disputed this for lack of information so the did, 2 weeks later I received a letter stating its my debt. The letter didn't have my social security number not even the last four digits, so I called them back and asked them to send me anything that I may have signed and they refused telling me they can't do that and that I need to get a police report instead after they will remove the debt from my credit report. I feel like no one is trying to help me resolve this issue that I clearly have no idea about nor have I ever been to the part of the state to accumulate this debt why won't they send me proof with my signature to prove it belongs to me.

27,"I applied for a personal loan, as I'm on long term XXXX. The loan was approved for {$1900.00} and my credit report and number was pulled. I signed the contract after requesting XXXX of the available limit. After signing the contract I was notified that my loan was denied."
28,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from this company stating they used my information to submit an application on my behalf in XX/XX/XXXX. 

They stole my identity and information for use of their own benefit. They lowered my credit score by fraudulent practices for their own benefit costing me careers, education, other financial services opportunities such as getting a bank account or credit card, a car and a mortgage. They directly impacted my life in a manner that cost me and my child ( ren ) their livelihood. 

They also ran my social security number over eleven times in XXXX and refused to acknowledge any of their mistakes instead stating that I was crazy. They would often gaslight me and say that calls I had with them did not happen though I recorded some of them and my account from my phone company does in fact reflect the calls were made. They have caused me mental anguish, anxiety and a loss of faith in the credit system and banks."
29,"I signed up for a Capital One Quick Silver Credit card, and got approved. The reason I chose this credit card was because I saw the advertised New cardmember bonus which would reward you {$200.00} if you spent {$500.00} in the first 3 months of owning this card. I signed up and turns out I didn't get the Newcard member bonus. So I called them and they explained that basically based on my credit score, I didn't receive the bonus. But nothing in the disclosures of this benefit says anything about not receiving the full benefits of the advertised {$200.00} Newcard member bonus. All it says and I fully read it, is that if you already have or have previously had a Captial one account you may not be eligible for this bonus. I never had a Capital one Credit card or account this is my first time. So they lied, made it up probably that it was cause of my credit score that I did not receive the bonus. I was unfairly denied the newcard member bonus. I should have received this benefit as it was advertised and I fell under the requirement which is being a new member. But I did not receive the bonus. I want to have the bonus that was clearly advertised as so, and also did not state that certain conditions apply in the advertisement. Just it saying new members get a {$200.00} bonus if they spend {$500.00} within the first 3 months of owning the credit card."
30,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email saying an order was picked up and my credit card was charged. I did not place an order and I was not even in the same state as the pickup location. 
I called immediately to dispute this. 
The card 's automated system kept going in circles and would not let me speak to a person, nor would it transfer me to the correct department of the button I was pressing. It asked for my social about 6 times. 
This company offers NO option to dispute a charge online, only to print a document and mail a physical copy. 
I was finally able to speak to a person after more than 2 hours of holding and transfers and calling back after disconnects. This person guaranteed me that the charge was removed the same day it was added, although I requested written confirmation of this and they declined. 
It is XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  and the charge is still there. 
I am absolutely sick of these fraudulent companies taking advantage of people who don't want to wait on hold for half a day. "" I apologize for the inconvenience '' - this isn't inconvenience, this is THEFT. 
Upon calling back, they had NO RECORD of any phone calls from XXXX or ever. They gave me COMPLETELY different information about "" the process '' and without my permission CLOSED THE ENTIRE ACCOUNT so now I can't use it at all - and this is an account that I use frequently for personal and business so the 5 % discount is substantial. 
The way Synchrony handles this is absolutely shameful and absurd and can only be designed to make people give up by frustration - these practices should be illegal."
31,I got a phone call from XXXX at XXXX. I was in a loud place so I kept saying hello. A lady told me to lower my voice in a rude tone. I told her not to speak to me in that deragotory manner and she ultimately called me a XXXX. She never said a name of who she was looking for and was very aggressive towards me from the onset. I called back and demanded that all calls be stopped unless they behave in a professional manner. Secondly they behaved as if they had a right to threaten and harras me because they think I owe a debt.
32,"I opened my Citi Accelerate on XXXX XXXX under the bonus terms as stipulated in the Welcome Package I received from Citi. I qualified for and completed all four activities and should have receive my {$450.00} bonus by XX/XX/XXXX at the latest. I still have not received it. 

I contacted a representative ( XXXX ) about the matter on XX/XX/XXXX. I received an on line notice today stating that my account was never linked to the promotion and therefore, I did not qualify for the promotion. 

When I opened the account the agent stated that it was opened with the promotional bonus plan, and that is why I received the Welcome Package with pages that specifically detail the bonus schedule. I copies of the promotional bonus plan detailed in my Welcome Package as proof. These are attached to my complaint.

39,"Bridgecrest is the company that I have my auto loan through. I recently spoke with them because I was told that if I was on the app I would see what day I would have to worry about my car being repossessed or being in repo status. I noticed a tow truck car driving by my house and decided to call them and I talk to a representative who then told me that I had had 24 failed bill pay payments go through my account since the beginning of the year of XXXX this was shocking to me because I knew that the total was always so high of what the bill and payments did they wanted were and then it never seem to go down a matter how much I Paid, Ive had this car and repossession status several times because they never are straight with what is going on with the account. I was told by this representative that XXXX XXXX bill pay was trying to take out every week or so money to pay on my loan, but I havent had a XXXX XXXX account since XXXX. Theres no way that I will have an account open in order to do a bill pay and when I called XXXX XXXX and ask them about it they had no idea what I was talking about so I asked Bridgecrest if they would refund the fees that come with each of these billpay payments being returned, which is adding up to be now hundreds of dollars And I was told no. I believe Bridgecrest is a predatory loan company I think that they dont want me to do well with this loan they dont want me to pay on time they want to repossess the car again because they know that I will get it out because Ive already done that twice. Ive proven that I have the ability to Pay the extra money that cost to get it repossessed and out of repossession. I think they bank on that and I think they live off those fees that theyre charging me off some bogus XXXX XXXX bill pay that no one can explain to me if you think about it 24 payments through this XXXX XXXX bill pay they charge me a return fee of {$24.00}. Every time thats over {$400.00} that that, I am owing that I should know because I never sent anything up like that. Im hesitant to pay them any money at all because Im not sure where they apply. It seems to only go towards the interest and never towards the principal and I am afraid that its in their best interest to repossess the car, rather than let me pay off the loan, also I was told that someone manually put me into repossession status, which is why I was not able to see it on the app and it came right after my negotiation with another auto dealer who would be willing to pay off my loan from Bridgecrest and instead lend to me for a new car. Its my belief that Bridgecrest would rather get the car and sell it then have me have someone pay off the 10 day payoff quote, which would be thousands of dollars that they would miss out on on these bogus fees."

42,"Subject : Cease and Desist Communication, Notice of Identity Theft, and Request for Debt Validation Dear Sir/Madam, My name is XXXX  XXXX XXXX a federally protected consumer. I'm filing this complaint to bring to your attention a matter of utmost concern regarding the alleged debt you claim I owe. This communication serves as a formal complaint, notice of identity theft, and a request for debt validation. 

First and foremost, I want to make it explicitly clear that I have never given Amsher Collection Services any permission to use or disclose any of my identifying information. It has come to my attention that you have been using my personal information, without my consent, to contact me about an alleged debt. This unauthorized use of my identifying information constitutes a severe violation of my privacy rights and is a clear case of identity theft. 

As a consumer protected by federal law, I am aware that the assignment of a defaulted note is illegal, as stated in Article 9. This implies that any purported assignment of the alleged debt to your agency is invalid and void. Consequently, both the assignee ( Amsher Collection Services ) and the assigned ( original creditor ) are liable for violations under 15 U.S. Code 1692e ( 12 ). 

In light of the above, I demand that you immediately cease and desist all communications with me regarding this alleged debt. Furthermore, I request that you provide me with the following information : 1. Proof of your authorization to contact me regarding this alleged debt.

2. Documentation verifying the existence and validity of the alleged debt.

3. Documentation showing that the original creditor lawfully assigned the debt to Amsher Collection Services. 

If you are unable to provide sufficient proof that I owe this alleged debt, I demand that you remove all references to this debt from your records and cease any further attempts to collect it. Failure to comply with this request will leave me no choice but to pursue legal action seeking {$1000.00} per violation, as provided by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

I expect a prompt response to this letter within 4 business days from your receipt. Your cooperation in resolving this matter amicably and without further delay will be greatly appreciated. Please send all correspondences regarding this issue to the address listed above. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, XXXX  XXXX"

44,ONLINE INFORMATION SERVICES is a result of identity theft. I recently discovered through my new monitoring service this account being reported I made efforts to remove this account from my file as the amount of {$1300.00} does not belong to me. This account was fraudulently opened through this company in XXXX of XXXX  an has been reported to the FTC and authorities as Identity theft. I have submitted all of my information needed to resolve this matter in this complaint and through the FTC report attached and do not feel comfortable giving any further information in any way to any others at this time due to the further possibilities of identity theft.
45,I had a prepaid card with Kikoff. They are showing an alleged {$6.00} pending balance on the account that is not mine. They have also reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus repeatedly because of this and have charged off my account since 2022. This has damaged my credit standing. Kikoff needs update this information to show a XXXX balance on this account and delete the alleged late notations and any reference to a chargeoff from my credit report immediately.
46,"Home Depot Credit Services sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX notifying me of new cards being sent to my business. The cards never arrived. They have since told me they mailed the cards to an address that I removed from my account over 9 years ago in XXXX. An address that was my mailing address only for approximately 5 months. They are now trying to say that the wrong address is the physical location of my business and it is NOT. That was never the physical location of my business. I asked them for something in writing showing who changed my physical business location to that address and when. They refuse to do that. They can not answer why the last time they issued a new card that it was sent to my current and correct address in XXXX of XXXX. 
I simply want a copy of the written request on my company letterhead that they have told me it takes for them to change the physical location of my business. I never changed the physical location of my business to that address in Maryland. I want a copy of the written request on my company letterhead that made them change my physical location to that address because I never sent them such a written request."
47,"This company continues to harm the consumer by knowingly reporting fraudulent information to XXXX, when there in fact HAS NEVER BEEN A CONSENSUAL CONTRACT BETWEEN CONSUMER AND THIS COMPANY. I am requesting debt VALIDATION as this company has violated the consumer in numerous ways, and XXXX accepts these fraudulent reports as accurate despite the multiple disputes."
48,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX I noticed fraudulent charges on my husband, XXXX XXXX, debit card that dated back approximately 2 weeks or less. On XX/XX/XXXX, {$370.00} was fraudulently charged to my husbands debit card, from various out of state venues, the bulk being XXXX XXXX in Tennessee. My husband and I have never been to Tennessee and haven't even been to the movies in a few years.I called Chase immediately and reported the charges. While speaking with the agent she entered all of the charges and then asked if I was sure that was all. I said maybe I should look back further and she encouraged me to do so. I found a few minor charges from a company that I did not recognize of less than {$8.00} each that were from XXXX and the rep said she would add those even though I said at the time that I wasnt even sure about them. I have never filed a claim for fraudulent charges and thought that if they were real charges they would just be ignored. They were such a minor amount that I had thought they were a minor purchase my husband had made and there was no fraudulent activity anytime soon after that that would have led me to investigate further. 

The money was credited back to my account but a few days later they were all debited again. Not only was the total of {$370.00} charged again, but additional charges of {$110.00} - again, mostly from XXXX XXXX in Tennessee were added as well. These had posted a few days AFTER I had reported my husbands card as compromised. I immediately called Chase and was told that because those 2 charges of less than {$8.00} were included, that ALL the charges were reinstated due to the fact those 2 minor charges were over 60 days old. I asked if I could just refile the current charges and I was told no. In addition, I was told that the charges that posted a few days AFTER I reported the fraud were my responsibility as well. I explained the circumstances that I have previously explained in this letter but was told it is policy. I worked my way up the chain, and was told time and again that it was policy and it sounded as though the agents were reading from a script as they said exactly the same lines over and over. I went to my local branch and they were very nice, and also seemed surprised at the circumstances but after calling the main claims department on my behalf were again told it was policy. 

I then filed a claim with the XXXX, and received a call from a Chase employee who was trying to help me resolve this issue. Although she was very nice and I believe she was genuinely trying to help, I was still told that the claims department said this was once again, their policy and Chase would not reconsider my case. I shared with her that this was my husbands debit card and that he was on XXXX and suffering from a currently incurable form of XXXX and neither of us might be as on top of minor charges as a result of the ongoing stress that this entails. She advised that I call the claims department again and let them know because there are exceptions for medical issues. I called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke to a few different people explaining my husbands medical condition as I hadnt realized that there might be an exception. They reopened the case after I provided medical documentation regarding his condition but a representative subsequently left a voicemail saying, .. just because he is ill doesnt mean that we will make an exception. 

I sent another letter on XX/XX/XXXX, letting them know that the early minor charges I had though MIGHT be false turned out to be legitimate and I thought they would have investigated and found this to be the case as well, but I heard nothing back from them. This alone delegitimizes their excuse for not reimbursing me, not to mention all the other circumstances involved in this case, but again, no response. 

I will be glad to forward all correspondence and voicemails upon request. It is my belief that Chase has engaged in unfair practices for a number of reasons that have been described in this letter and I am hopeful that the Consumer Finance Protection Board can help me to receive fair treatment as well as helping to prevent this type of thing from happening to others in the future. Thank you for your consideration."
49,"I filed an complaint with there fraud department due to an incident where the was an overdraft on my checking and savings accounts.

50,"I just bought my first home. I made it very clear to the lender that I was not going to pay points. As a matter of fact, I sent this email to him when he sent me an estimate after I told him that. 
"" I thought you said there was no origination fee? But on this form it says origination charges 1.776 % of loan amount and then it says ( points ). That's very high. Can you please clarify? Are there points or not on this loan? And if this is not an origination fee, why does it say it is? I do not want to pay points and why is this fee there. I understand this can be negotiated and I'd feel much better if this fee was not here or it were a lower rate. The payment keeps going up and up and up. I feel like I'm paying a high interest rate already and now an origination fee? Most origination are XXXX5 to 1 %, this is almost 2 %. '' And he said this ... ... There is no free interest rates in todays crazy market & that is not a choice of mine. The Federal government dictates the cost of interest rates. Rate costs are essentially mandatory right now because investors know that people will be refinancing in the very near future & if they did not get up front money for their investment, they would lose XXXX of dollars. '' I told him over and over no points. He made it out to say that they were not points but that he had to "" buy '' the loan. At closing, again, he said they were not points but he had to put them in that spot. 
I am a 100 % XXXX veteran and have never bought a home before. I had a lot of questions and he made a lot of promises and then double talked them. I have XXXX and a XXXX XXXX, am on a lot of meds and feel like he took advantage of this. After the closing, he never contacted me again and sold my loan within a week. He would not answer my questions and would not assist me with things he said he would. He promised that the loan rate would go down in XXXX and that we would refinance. He lied and lied and I feel really XXXX  but I was afraid to lose the house as the person who sold it had to take an offer asap. 
In addition to the loan issues, he inappropriately ( he was married and so was she ) and aggressively pursued my female real estate agent ( and friend ) and told her lies about the loan too. She was a novice. On more than one occasion, she asked me to stay with her so she would not have to be alone with him. 
The bottom line is that I can not find anyone to help me with a solid answer as to how it is okay to lie and misrepresent loan fees and points, especially to a XXXX veteran. He also added all the closing costs to my loan after telling me that I was not going to pay any closing costs. The name of the company is Supreme Lending ( Everett Financial ) and the individual who did this is XXXX XXXX."

63,"I want my credit report to be accurate and by law you need to remove accounts that are inaccurate, incomplete. This is not a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for validation made pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g. I request your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you.

15 U.S. Code 1692g - Validation of debts ( a ) Notice of debt ; contents Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing -- ( 1 ) the amount of the debt ; ( 2 ) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector ; ( 4 ) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector ; and ( 5 ) a statement that, upon the consumer 's written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.

( b ) Disputed debts If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection ( a ) of this section that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector. Collection activities and communications that do not otherwise violate this subchapter may continue during the 30-day period referred to in subsection ( a ) unless the consumer has notified the debt collector in writing that the debt, or any portion of the debt, is disputed or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor. Any collection activities and communication during the 30-day period may not overshadow or be inconsistent with the disclosure of the consumers right to dispute the debt or request the name and address of the original creditor.

Be advised this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g stating your claim is disputed and validation is required. 


Henceforth, I will also inform you that you have reported invalidated information to any of the XXXX major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX or XXXX ), this may constitute Fraud under both Federal and State Laws. So, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit report by your company or the company that you represent, I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and Defamation of Character.

If your offices can deliver all proper documentation as required in the following Declaration, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information, during which time all collection activity must cease and desist. Also, during this validation period, I will consult with my Legal counsel for suit. This will include any listing of any information to a credit reporting repository that could be invalidated. 


In case of any failure to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately Sincerely,"

I now have a closed account on my credit history and would like this removed.
66,"During the purchase of a home I was initially quoted in writing from the loan officer ( XXXX XXXX ) at DHI a loan estimate which has changed several times now. Each time the numbers changed and did not make sense to me. I consulted with the Mortgage processor XXXX, who is the person in charge of my file and is responsible for gathering all the final documents for the underwriters review. I asked her if she could perhaps explain the substantially large increase on my file in XXXX 's absence as XXXX told me I can go to XXXX while she is out of the office for any questions. XXXX also was confused about the increase on the loan estimate dated XX/XX/2023. The only extra charge she understood and was able to explain was an extra {$500.00} dollars that I am being charged extra because the property I am trying to purchase appraised lower than expected and I have to pay the difference. XXXX said she would let XXXX 's boss XXXX XXXX XXXX know about the situation and she would get back to me regarding all other extra charges. When I spoke with XXXX and I questioned an additional {$8800.00} XXXX payment charge appearing on my loan estimate she could not give me an answer and said she would have to get back with me. I then asked for help from my realtor XXXX, he and I asked to speak with the Loan officer manageXXXX ( XXXX ) once again and while on a conference call on XX/XX/2023 she admitted that her loan officer ( XXXX XXXX ) had made several mistakes on my loan estimate. These mistakes include Property taxes errors for improved land versus unimproved land. This large sum difference was added to my down payment line item. When I asked XXXX about the additional XXXX she said this was a glitch in their system. I asked her why if she knew about the glitch, why it was not fixed and she could not answer. She seemed puzzled with my question. At this point I felt that I am deliberately being confused by this Representative. It feels like a bait and switch scheme when she talks about the numbers. I am now extremely concerned because I was expecting to close on the home on XX/XX/2023 and with that in mind I paid down payments on movers and made many arrangements to move. All of this insecurity has me very nervous and can cause me to lose a lot of money as I am purchasing this new home to accommodate my XXXX mom that lives with me and as I explained to the loan officer originally I need this home as it is handicap accessible and it will help me assist my moms deeds.

I work Monday through Friday XXXX, so I couldn't answer the call, he did not leave a voicemail, but instead decided to call my younger sister, XXXX XXXX XXXX who was also working. She is not listed anywhere as a guardian, or emergency contact. 

She answered the call, and described the call as aggressive, and that he was an attorney trying to reach me, he mentioned the University XXXX XXXX, and that he was asking for my employer, and where I lived. This caused her to call me, she was very distressed, and said that he was being very aggressive, and it made her worried that I was in some legal trouble of some sort. Now I can hardly focus at work on a busy Monday morning. 

I called and made a complaint, and informed them I was filing this complaint to you as I believe that this was a violation of CFPBs Debt Collection Rule.

He transferred me over to her. I asked her to remove me from their list and to confirm with XXXX XXXX. She stated that she would remove me, but if the balance is not paid.. I reminded her that it was up to her company to validate the debt before calling me back and that I would take legal action should I be negatively impacted for a debt that is already paid. 

I am reporting this because I do not have any confidence that this company will do their due diligence ve to validate the debt."

I once account was open I used the balance transfer of {$10000.00} from my Bank America account to XXXX account. That was XX/XX/XXXX, that the balance transfer was confirmed by XXXX. Weeks go by Bank of America reflects no reduction of the transfer amount of {$10000.00}. I call XXXX and they stated they sent the funds to Bank of America. XXXX instructs me to call Bank of America as the issue is on their side. I call and Bank of America says no they did not receive the funds to call XXXX. Call XXXX back and told the funds are sent and will hit my Bank of America account in a day or two. I wait a week nothing. I called both banks several times including XX/XX/XXXX when Bank of America agent states they see the {$10000.00} funds disputed and unsure why and what. But then not shown in transactions. She was confused and sent me to the transfer department directly. Transfer department says no nothing there and no dispute to go to XXXX bank. Got nowhere with either bank then. Called again a day later and told by XXXX to verify the account I do so and mention it was several times. Person at XXXX says the issue is the wrong account info given.

73,"On XX/XX/2023, I filed CFPB complaint # XXXX, in which I alleged retaliation against me by Capital One for my raising concerns and allegations of unfair, deceptive and abusive practices related to graduating my secured Platinum to an unsecured credit card. I also filed this same complaint with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on XX/XX/XXXX. In this complaint, I also expressed concerns and made allegations of abuse and retaliation against me by their agents, XXXX ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ) and XXXX. ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from XXXX, Principal Complaints Coordinator at Capital One ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ), who called me at XXXX XXXX. PST on a recorded line, when I was living in XXXX -- and also the address listed on my account -- and on Pacific Standard Time. I have attached the XXXX call logs from my phone number, showing that XXXX XXXX XXXX to me at XXXX XXXX  was illegally made outside the hours at which a financial institution may not call me before XXXX XXXX. local time to the address on the account. As noted, and as was said on the recorded call, XXXX violated the law and called me at XXXX XXXX. local time from an XXXX area code. I informed XXXX of this violation on the call. On this call with XXXX, we discussed the behavior from agents XXXX ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ) and XXXX. ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ), and I alleged retaliation by Capital One for restricting my accounts on XX/XX/XXXX, after only a week prior to this, I had filed a complaints alleging unfair, deceptive, abusive and unlawful practices with my Capital One Platinum secured credit card. I also expressed concerns that XXXX had told lies on my call with her and she made a threat of retaliation to re-restrict my accounts after I became frustrated and dissatisfied with her behavior. XXXX then read to me the transcripts of the calls with XXXX and XXXX, and he agreed that the call from XXXX could have been handled better. Regarding the call with XXXX, he agreed that she did, in fact, lie on that call -- she said I called her XXXX XXXX ' but as XXXX read the call transcript to me, he said on multiple occasions that I did not say that at all. Instead, as XXXX read back to me, I asked of myself : "" How XXXX do you think I am? '' XXXX agreed to forward both of these calls, along with his findings and the call transcripts, to the next level above him : Capital One 's XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX stated that he believed that particularly my call with XXXX warranted an internal review for the way I was treated. I asked XXXX, still on the recorded line, if I had done anything abusive or anything that warranted Capital One closing my accounts for my conduct, and he assured me -- on the recorded call -- that no, I was not abusive toward any of the agents. Also on this recorded call, XXXX told me that Capital One policy is that if a customer is abusive or uses foul language, company policy is to send a warning letter to the customer prior to any credit revocation or fore-closing of accounts. I have received no such thing. On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I learned, by way of looking at XXXX XXXX that my Capital One accounts had been closed. Capital One intentionally, knowingly and falsely reported that all three credit card accounts were closed on XX/XX/2023. This date of closure is knowingly, intentionally and deliberately false and inaccurate ; Capital One, again, reported this false data in retaliation for my continued, legitimate complaints against them, their business practices and their agents ' conduct. I have attached a screen shot of the information showing the accounts were falsely and inaccurately reported as closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I have also included the most recent credit card statement for my XXXX XXXX account ending in XXXX, which very clearly shows that charges were made on, and posted to, the account on and after XX/XX/XXXX, when Capital One alleges the accounts were closed. Also on XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to a Capital One representative, a Fraud and Disputes Supervisor named XXXX ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ), who refused to verbally tell me why my accounts were closed ; he told me it was against company policy to tell me that information and that I had to wait for a letter in the main. Again, I expressed to XXXX my assertion that Capital One was retaliating against me. XXXX never once acknowledged this or took action when he was told, many times on the call, that I believe Capital One is engaging in business practices that violate the law and my rights as a consumer. I then called back and spoke to XXXX ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ) a supervisor in the Escalations Department. XXXX verbally shared with me that all my Capital One credit card accounts were closed due to my abusive behavior on a call that took place on XX/XX/XXXX. I advised XXXX that the only call I had to or from Capital One that day was from XXXX, the Principal Complaints Coordinator who is mentioned in this complaint. I asked XXXX if it was possible that there was a mix-up between XXXX filing a complaint on my behalf for the threatening and abusive call I had with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX agreed to look into it and placed me on hold. When she returned to the call, she was unable to tell me the exact details of the allegedly abusive call that Capital One claims occurred that triggered the force-closing of all my accounts When I pressed XXXX for more detail, again alleging that Capital One is engaging in illegal business practices and retaliation, she refused to answer any more of my questions and began threatening to disconnect the call. When I told XXXX I had more questions, she refused to address them and once again, on a recorded line, threatened to disconnect the call -- and she did for no valid reason. I have a mountain of evidence to substantiate my claims, concerns, assertions and allegations that Capital One has abused me, treated me unfairly, deliberately stated lies on recorded phone calls, broken their company policies -- particularly the policy that XXXX quoted to me on receiving warning letters prior to force-closing accounts if Capital One alleges abusive behavior by a customer, recorded threats of retaliation by XXXX, falsifying data that has already been reported to the credit bureaus, and retaliating against me by closing all my accounts because I blew the whistle and spoke up about the illegal, threatening, retaliatory actions and behavior exhibited by Capital One and its employees. I am fully prepared to take this case before a court of law if Capital One does not wish to resolve this amicably and with a mutually agreeable resolution -- and the evidence I have amassed more than substantiates my claims. Capital One has also caused harm to my credit score and credit file, and I have suffered credit and financial losses as a direct result of Capital One force-closing my accounts. I am also concerned and worried that Capital One has collected my sensitive, private and confidential information, including bank statements with full account numbers, when I was asked to provide them all this info and data on XX/XX/XXXX. It's worth noting that any time I file any type of complaint against Capital One -- whether internally or with regulatory bodies -- my accounts immediately and suspiciously become restricted and labeled as "" fraud, '' yet Capital One never once substantiates their claims of fraud. I believe that Capital One is intentionally and knowingly attempting to intimidate and silence me -- and possibly other customers -- from coming forward with legitimate complaints and allegations, by making any rectifying difficult, cumbersome and impossible. Again, I am fully willing and prepared to bring suit against Capital One in a court of law if we can not reach a mutually agreeable solution to my issues. In summary, Capital One is brazenly attempting to steamroll and bulldoze customers who they believe won't fight back, and I am not the type of person ; I will pursue this to the fullest extent of the law and seek all civil, criminal and other penalties for the financial and emotional harm Capital One has inflicted upon me."

Was an individual depositor 's money deposit used in order to pay the vendors when I made charges to my account? 
XXXX. Was the money that was loaned created by my signing of the voucher when I made the purchase? 
XXXX. Is it your Bank policy to create checkbook money in amounts equal to the charges made by Bank customers?

75,"I deposited 3 personal checks into my account on XX/XX/XXXX, initially my receipt stated funds would be released in 3 business days, a day later I received an email stating my funds were put on hold and would not be available for 8 days, in total that was a 9 day hold. On XX/XX/XXXX the hold was removed and my available balance reflected the amount of deposits. On XX/XX/XXXX I went into a branch to withdrawal some funds. I had my ID but my debit card was in the car, I told the teller this. I asked could I use my ID he stated yes, I called the person in the car & asked if they could just bring it in which they did. The teller asked for an override from the supervisor on duty before I retrieved my debit card due to me not having it, I stated to the supervisor I now had the debit card and showed her this with proof of license. The supervisor looked at me and continued to input some things in her computer 5 minutes passed she asked me to have a seat and went to the back with my ID, 5 minute later she returned handed me my ID and stated they would not be able to process my withdrawal. I asked why and she said we just cant! I tell her you all held my funds for 8 days and just dont tell me anything? She said yes. I leave and immediately call customer support, who stated they had no information on why the funds were held and referred me to risk management who then referred me to client relations. Client relations had no information on why the my account was hold. Im frustrated at this point I hang up and call back the next day same scenario. I call Saturday someone states my account is in the process of closing I ask why she stated thats not my line of business and referred me back to client relations. I finally get someone again in client relations and tell me the account is not up for closure just on hold and they could not tell me a timeframe on when the hold would be lifted when I could access my funds OR WHY? It is now 17 days into my initial deposit and I can not access my funds. I have children bills etc and BANK OF AMERICA will not tell me why my account is on hold I have not received any letters, emails or phone calls on why the hold was put in place. At this point im ready to seek legal counsel because this is ludacris!!!"
76,On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment for my Lowes credit card I received my confirmation email stating I had made my payment. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating that my payment was processed.

I tried explaining all this to customer service agent and verified everything I mentioned above. The agent was unable to help me and so I asked for a XXXX. The XXXX continued to insinuate that I made those extra charges and auto pay enrollment. I mentioned to her OVER AND OVER AGAIN that I did not make to authorization which is why I was calling in the first place. They were unable to help me either or give me any explanation for double payments and enrolling me without my consent to autopay.

We received proof from NYS that Mr Cooper was paid 3 paymentsthe first to bring our mortagage current, the second for 3 months of payments and the 3rd for another 3 months of payments ( 6 full months of advance payments ) This brought us to XX/XX/XXXX with a small credit to be applied upon us resuming our monthly payments. Instead, our funds from NYS were incorrectly applied by Mr Cooper ( toward principle ) and then reversed due to that misappropriation by Mr Cooper. Two payments were then never reapplied to our balance so we were being told that we had past due mortgage payments in excess of {$5000.00}. I have spent months on the phone talking to countless people to resolve this issue without success. Essentially Mr Cooper stole our NYS Homeowners Assistance Fund money and are now sending us letters saying we are in risk of foreclosure and we are over 175 days past due. I have sent countless documents of proof and even a line by line breakdown of how payments should have been applied and the line by line balance. After months of fighting with Mr Cooper to resolve this issue we still have not had the payments applied to our account and our risk of foreclosure letter has a must resolve date of XX/XX/XXXX.

They have sent me a letter stating that they are not reporting it, but the other banks have verbally stated that the reason for closure or for me to be unable to open an checking account is because of what's being reported to Early Warning. This is literally the example of holding my banking privileges XXXX and this is illegal in nature.

111,"To Whom It May Concern, I wanted to reach out and provide detail with respect to a credit card dispute in the above-referenced case in the amount of {$1700.00} from XX/XX/XXXX. 

THESE SERVICES WERE NOT RECEIVED AND I HAVE FILED WITH THE CFPB AND DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. 

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME AS I CAN NOT SEEM TO PROVIDE THESE FACTS TO AN ACTUAL PERSON AND THE DISPUTE WAS SETTLED WITH ME HAVING TO PAY. 


For this transaction, the details are that on XX/XX/XXXX I submitted an order with online vendor "" XXXX ''. The initial reservation detail indicated travel from XXXX to XXXX and then back to XXXX XXXX XXXX for a work trip. A screenshot of this is attached ( see "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ). 

When I reviewed the actual travel portal the discount booking service had booked the trip from XXXX back to XXXX Arizona- which was incorrect. I immediately tried to call them. They have no phone number - only an e-mail address. I contacted this e-mail address and they only provided me with the screenshot of the incorrect booking. 

Note that I made the booking for an airline and contacted them within a few minutes ( about an hour ) from the original purchase. According to UXXXX Department of Transportation rules, this airline ( or the travel agent ) I think should have been able to immediately refund the flight or change to the correct flight. The screenshot of the incorrect booking from their system just reiterates the point that there was an error with the ticket. 

Contacting the vendor 's chat team was incredibly difficult. There were many spelling typos and they did not understand my request ( see "" XXXX Customer Service '' ). I have also tried to communicate with this vendor over e-mail. Their online spelling and communication is very difficult- there are many typos ( and no phone number ) ( see "" XXXX E-mail XXXX '' and "" XXXX e-mail 2 '' ). In these communications, they frustratingly just sent me the picture of their incorrect system and did not offer any solutions. 

This is a lesson learned. In looking at XXXX, many customers have had this issue. There are over XXXX reviews and over XXXX of them are one star due to similar issues. 

Because of this issue, I immediately booked the correct travel directly with another airline ( with the accurate booking ). 

I have also filed a detailed dispute with the US Department of Transportation who appears to have a file on this merchant for similar issues ( see "" Department of Transportation Referral '' ). 

I wanted to provide this detail to you for the above-noted case so that you may have the information necessary to hopefully proceed. 

I hope this can be resolved favorably. I have not received any merchandise or services from this vendor and, in fact, they appear to have just cancelled my reservation in their system ( see "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ). 

Many thanks for your time and assistance- have a great week. 

Best, XXXX"
112,"This is complaint number XXXX for the same issue. Chase continues to "" lose '' my payments that are coming from a XXXX party payer. I am XXXX years XXXX and have had this loan since XXXX of XXXX. From XXXX of XXXX to XXXX of XXXX, I made all of my payments on time. I became XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX and per XXXX XXXX ( where my payments are coming from ), I can not submit my monthly XXXX statement to them any earlier than the week of the XXXX of every month, because that is where my XXXX date falls on. I have conveyed this to Chase MANY times. I understand that my payment due date is the XXXX of each month, however, I have no control over XXXX XXXX  policies as well. As of today 's date they have not posted the FINAL payment, and I continue to be assessed late fees. I have escalated this all the way up to the Executive Office at Chase Auto Finance. A representative by the name of XXXX XXXX in Chase Auto Finance, who handled the previous complaint, conveniently told my insurance rep XXXX that my payment due date could be changed. I find this amusing that it can be changed 2 months prior to the loan being paid in full, when I asked if it could be changed XXXX years ago and was told no. I have consulted with my attorney who has advised me to keep filing these complaints and keep track of them. She has also advised me that I am NOT responsible for the late fees, as this is out of my control. As of today, I've been charged another {$15.00} late charge for a check that was mailed XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$610.00}. This whole issue is discriminatory to people with XXXX and creates unneeded stress to me which is not good for any of my health conditions. XXXX XXXX is doing their job correctly, Chase is not. I have been told that I am not the only account this happens to, which to me should be a sign that their process needs to be reevaluated and modified."
113,"Dear Sir or Madam : I have twice submitted requests to my mortgage servicer, Newrez LLC, to have my escrow account for taxes and insurance deleted ( XX/XX/23 and XX/XX/23 ) as I believe that I now have sufficient equity in my home to obviate the need for said escrow account. However, my request was denied on both occasions ( XX/XX/23 and XX/XX/23 ) with the following reason the LTV ratio does not meet the minimum requirement for your state or property type Based on the above denial reason, I twice submitted follow-up questions to Newrez LLC XXXX XX/XX/23 and XX/XX/23 ) as follows 1 ) What is the current LTV ratio of my loan? 
2 ) What is the minimum LTV ratio requirement to delete my escrow account?

Since both of my requests were denied for LTV ratio reasons, I had assumed that Newrez LLC would have the answers to both of the above questions readily available. However, as of today ( XX/XX/23 ), I have yet to receive a response from Newrez LLC to either of the above questions. 

The silence has been deafening as it leads me to believe that Newrez LLC does not have any basis for continuing to maintain my escrow account but would rather continue to pad their balance sheet with my money ( and the money of other borrowers in my position ) rather than perform the proper due diligence to ensure that only borrowers with insufficient equity will be required to maintain escrow accounts with Newrez LLC."
114,"I opened a Money market Savings account and met all the requirements to receive a bonus of {$500.00}. Per Ally bank, the bonus should have deposited on XX/XX/XXXX. 

After not seeing the bonus for a month, I called and got XXXX # XXXX opened. 

Then on XX/XX/XXXX I got a voicemail from Ally bank and called them back and spoke to a person named XXXX, who informed me that the bonus was deposited, but into another account. That account is not owned by me, but by a XXXX which was set by me and my husband. 

XXXX said she will correct it and she executed a transfer of {$500.00} from the XXXX account to my account. But while this corrects the balance, the bonus is taxable and is included in the XXXX interest. I told her the XXXX interest is now wrong on two accounts. 

Hence, these are the issues involved that CFPB and regulating agencies need to look into : 1 ) ALLY Bank deposits bonus late by over 2 months 2 ) ALLY bank put the bonus into another account with different title and ownership 3 ) ALLY bank call center representative is authorized to move money from one customer 's account to another customer 's account - which is very dangerous.

4 ) ALLY bank deposits the bonus two months late and says they do not owe me any lost interest on the late deposit of the bonus, implying that they are not bound by the terms of the initial account opening agreement."
115,"Dear Chase Inc, You closed my account ending in XXXX due to the reason of "" Too many requests for credit or reviews of credit ''. This is highly inaccurate as I just checked my credit reports for all 3 major and 5 other minor credit bureaus.

They sent me an email to send any documents I could to provide any evidence to make my case ( basically investigate my own situation, something they should have done for me as their customer! ). I called the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX in XXXX ( the store here the purchase was made ) and asked if they were able to bring up footage of that date and they said they would need a police report. I called the non-emergency line at the XXXX Police Department and filed a report for fraudulent charges and explained the situation which is now under investigation. I sent these documents to the email provided by Cap One. I am awaiting reply by the XXXX."
141,"I was first called by Anfi in regards to owing some sort of debt due to a car accident. The total stating to be {$1500.00} USD. Not only did the man not listen to me over the phone when I was trying to communicate with them but he told me that he would report me and take legal actions. He also told me that only my insurance company could dispute a debt. Which I know is not true. This happened around XXXX of XXXX. I decided to no longer communicate over the phone and send everything through certified mail. I requested proof of the debt along with proof of other information, which I will be attaching below. This letter was sent XX/XX/XXXX. Once I actually did receive a response the only thing that was attached was an estimate. Not even any kind of receipt or proof that I specifically owe that debt. On this packet was a new amount apparently that I owed. This new total was listed at {$3000.00} USD. Why they would tell me I owe almost double what they originally claimed I owed and then not even show any proof of where this is coming from was a total shock to me. I then sent another verification of debt letter in the attempts to identify where this was coming from and why I owe them any money. Not only did they not send any information again, the only piece of mail I received from them was supposedly a discounted offer which they listed at {$1500.00} USD. Not even a settlement of any kind just some sort of discounted offer. This was sent from them on XX/XX/XXXX. I do not owe this amount and they refuse to provide anything Ive asked for."

I do not, and never have had, a Square account. When I called to ask them why I got this they cancelled and were very cordial, but I have no idea why this would've been sent to me, and don't see any glaring signs of fraud / identity theft with other accounts. Looking online it was recommended I file a note with the CFPB to review- it appears I'm not the only person this has happened to."
143,"I went under forbearance because my spouse lost her job because of XXXX. The agreement was to postpone payments until we were better situated. During the forbearance period, random visitors showed up at our house asking "" Is this house occupied ''? We were confused as to why these people were showing up and we warned them that we will call the police if they continued to invade our privacy. They were caught peeking through our windows and taking pictures of our home as if planning something. 

We contacted Pennymac and they informed us that they used a 3rd party to investigate and they will send a complaint for harassment. We had the same lady show up again a week after this conversation. Another representative said they were moving forward with a foreclosure anticipating that I would not be able to make payments in the future. This home was purchased under a VA loan which states that companies can not foreclose without appearing in court. 

Furthermore, the forbearance was not supposed to have an impact on my credit score. Because of the alleged delinquency, I have not been able to purchase a more reasonable vehicle and my security clearance is also at risk. 

I was also assigned a "" Trustee '' that is NOT a legal resident of Tennessee, which is a requirement to be listed on a DEED OF TRUST in the state of Tennessee. We have had our rights violated on multiple occasions since XX/XX/2022."

3. Proof of Agreement : Please provide documentation demonstrating a legally binding agreement between myself and the original creditor, proving that I am responsible for this debt.

4. Chain of Ownership : If the debt has been assigned or sold to your agency, please provide documentation establishing your legal authority to collect on this debt. This includes a chain of ownership that clearly identifies each successive owner of the debt.

148,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally lodge a comprehensive complaint against Ally Financial for their role in the unfair and deceptive practices during my purchase of a XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX  Misrepresentation of Loan Terms : Ally Financial processed and approved a loan for my vehicle, which I believed to have an interest rate of XXXX  % based on the initial invoice contract dated XX/XX/XXXX. However, upon receipt of my first billing statement, I found that the interest rate was substantially higher, at XXXX  %. This discrepancy has resulted in a significantly increased financial burden and inflated overall cost of the vehicle. 

2.  Inconsistent Financing Terms : The terms of the loan presented to me were inconsistent. The initial invoice contract stated the price and financing terms clearly but did not mention any stipulations related to arbitration. However, the subsequent Retail Installment Contract signed on XX/XX/XXXX, introduced an arbitration clause, significantly altering the terms to my disadvantage. This change was neither clarified nor adequately explained to me. 

3.  Undisclosed Relationships and Potential Kickbacks : I have reasons to believe that Ally Financial and XXXX XXXX XXXX may have a pre-existing business relationship, possibly involving kickbacks or incentives, which was not disclosed to me during the negotiation or finalization of my vehicle purchase. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the fairness and legitimacy of the loan terms and interest rate. 

4. Noncompliance with TILA : Ally Financial 's failure to accurately disclose the terms of my auto loan, as well as their potential noncompliance with the arbitration disclosure requirements, may constitute violations of the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). TILA mandates that lenders provide borrowers with clear, accurate, and meaningful information about the cost and terms of credit. 

These alleged malpractices by Ally Financial are not only detrimental to me but also potentially harmful to a wider consumer base. I, therefore, appeal to the CFPB to exercise its authority to investigate and rectify these injustices. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am confident that the CFPB will uphold its commitment to consumer protection and ensure fair practices in the auto financing industry."
149,"Bank of America received a garnishment request from The State of NC Department of Revenue for {$1500.00}. The request was dated XX/XX/XXXX! 

BofA placed a hold on all of my accounts ( XXXX accounts ) on XXXX. When the hold was placed only 3 of my 5 accounts had funds available ( {$53.00} ; {$0.00} and {$450.00} ) which was withheld. BofA then placed a {$1000.00} hold for the remaining amount of the garnishment on each my accounts. This caused each of my accounts to be negative- {$1000.00} ( - {$5200.00} total amount negative across all 5 accounts ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX I had direct deposits from my employer totaling {$2700.00} credit my account. I have been receiving these direct deposit for over 3 years and have never had issues with them being returned. I called the bank to see when the remainder of my funds would be released because there was more than enough funds to cover the entire garnishment order from The State of NC and was ultimately told that it could take 10 days for the hold to be removed.

I asked several times if I could speak with someone in the legal department and was told they didnt take calls. I then asked to speak with a supervisor who told me that it could take 10 days for my funds to be released as the bank had a legal order they had to follow because they had to chase me down for money and I dont pay my bills. The supervisor acknowledged that BofA was knowingly and willingly withholding more funds that what was requested on the garnishment but that it was a process that needed to be followed for the hold to be released. I asked if the process could be done today and was told no. 

It does not sit well with me that BofA will uphold their duty legally with The State of NC but not uphold the legal duty they have with me as a consumer."
150,"XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, I made an online electronic payment from my XXXX XXXX  checking account to Comenity Capital Bank in the amount of {$200.00}. The payment was intended to be applied to my NFL Extra Points Visa credit card with Comenity Capital Bank. I have used this method of payment many times in the past for this credit card and all of my other bills. 

A few days later, I received a notification from Comenity that my payment for XX/XX/XXXX was not received. I checked my XXXX  bill pay account and realized that I made the XX/XX/XXXX payment to Comenity Capital Bank, but I inadvertently applied the payment to the wrong account number. 

My previous NFL Extra Point Visa account number was XXXX. I made my XX/XX/XXXX, payment to this account number. I should have made the payment using my current account number ending in XXXX. 

I called Comenity Capital Banks Customer Service number and spoke to a representative to explain the error. The representative said that they could not find my payment in their records and that I would need to mail in a copy of my electronic payment to their dispute department. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a copy of the proof of electronic payment from my bank account bill pay and a letter explaining the error to the dispute department at Comenity Capital Bank. 

From XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, I called Comenity Capital Banks Customer Service number and talked to several customer service representatives and managers who all told me that they received my dispute documents but were unable to apply my {$200.00} payment to my account until the investigation was concluded. Initially, I was told that the investigation would take 7-10 business days and then later I was told that it could take up to 90 business days. It seemed outrageous and impractical that the bank would receive a {$200.00} payment from me to my old closed account number but was clueless about how to transfer and apply that payment to my current account. 

Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Comenity Capital Bank stating they need additional evidence that I made the XX/XX/XXXX payment. I called Comenity Capital Banks Customer Service number and was informed that they wanted me to have my bank trace the payment and their investigation would take an addition

al 90 business days.

I can not express the frustration that I am experiencing with this entire situation. I made a payment to the correct bank that has all of my information but used the incorrect account number and Comenity Capital Bank has kept my money and is acting as if they cant find it for over 5 months now. This is outrageous and unprofessional and predatory and I want my {$200.00} payment applied to my current account and all late fees removed immediately.

153,"A stranger made fraudulent purchases of approximately {$2500.00} on one of my XXXX XXXX credit cards issued by Citibank. 

The perpetrator has been found, and charged with felony credit card fraud : However, Citibank has refused to reimburse the card. This has been extremely stressful over the past couple of months. 

The credit card issuer credited my account after filing the dispute : However, the {$2500.00} in charges just appeared again on my credit card statement, and I subsequently received an e-letter stating that the investigation is complete, and I am now responsible for all of the charges -- No explanation. 

Moreover, they further stated in the letter that if I failed to make payments on the fraudulent chargers, they would report it to the credit bureaus. This is particularly disturbing as I currently have a credit score of XXXX ( Exceptional ) -- Based on a perfect payment history. Consequently, I have no choice but to continue to pay on the fraudulent charges. 

The investigative department of the credit card issuer has been very deceitful. Currently, I am weighing my legal options."

My insurance company named them on the check and trying to get the check returned has been impossible. No one from management returns a call, no one knows what's going on and it's nothing but continued excuses.

156,Had a secured credit card at Navy Federal. Went over secured credit limit. Remaining balance was decreased with the secured funds but the remainder sat for 9 months before I could handle the situation. The checking account was closed but the savings was still in use for the 9 months. Had transactions during this time. Two weeks ago I started back working wanted to take care of my debts. First check was basically absorbed by this process. Then I made another payment to the balance. With less than 400 left to pay it off the bank takes the remainder of my balance in my account and puts it in the negative. The bank says they have to put a hold on the account for the secured amount because the account still has a balance and if I want it lifted I have to pay off the remaining balance. During the last 9 months my account was open and being used. No hold. Now that I put a direct deposit in the account they put a hold on my funds without notice. They said they just took that secured payment in XXXX of 2022 but it was before that and like I said I have had random deposits go into that account. I want the hold lifted and any payments that was disrupted because of them set right.
157,"As indicated in the earlier complaint on XX/XX/XXXX I came out of forbearance due to Covid. Since then, I have made monthly payments to Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) of {$3400.00}. In XXXX payments of {$3400.00} were made on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. In response to my earlier complaint SLS reported that on XX/XX/XXXX deferral was processed and the account was current. 

3 weeks ago, I was notified that my credit rating was reduced from XXXX to XXXX due to late and missed mortgage payments to SLS. The SLS message center claimed that my account was past due. I sent SLS the canceled checks showing that payments have been made and ask for a correction of the credit report. 

A XX/XX/XXXX SLS Message claims my XXXX payments have been late and that I owe {$15000.00}. I sent SLS copies of all 12 canceled SLS checks each for {$3400.00} for XXXX. As indicated with the checks, I have always made payments on or about the XXXX of each month, which was my due date. 

During XXXX I have received no indication or any reporting from SLS that my payments were up to 57 days late and that I was accruing delinquent late fees. The only correspondence from SLS was 6 notices of Intent to Foreclose ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ). In addition, SLS has not provided a XXXX Form 1098 Mortgage Interest Statement. 

In XXXX payments of {$3400.00} have been made on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and a payment was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Since I have received zero monthly statements from SLS for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX I requested then in writing on XX/XX/XXXX, which I received this week. The provided XX/XX/XXXX Mortgage Statement claims I owe {$16000.00} due to late fees and missed payments. 

If required, I can provide copies of all canceled checks that SLS has cashed. 

Thank-you for your attention to this matter."
158,"Not the first problem with Bank of America. Their business model is to take money from consumers to which they are not entitled, and then refuse to give it back on a timely basis. 

While the amount in question is not that large, if they repeat this process with thousands and thousands of consumers, it gives the bank funds that they can invest and earn money at the expense of innocent consumers. 

If I did that, I would be arrested and charged with a crime, but Bank of America feels they are above the law. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a {$3500.00} payment to my account ending in XXXX. At that time, the balance was {$3600.00}, with the account in good standing. That same day, I made a payment of {$170.00}, paying the account to XXXX. 

The next day, my account was debited for {$120.00} which was presumably the amount due under the autodebit which was set up to pay the minimum payment, resulting in a credit balance of {$120.00}. OK, I guess that could happen, maybe the debits/credits "" crossed in the mail '' so to speak. 

But my issue is, Bank of America REFUSES to give me my {$120.00} back, on a timely basis. My suggestion was, apply the {$120.00} to a {$360.00} balance I have in another account, and they I asked to initiate a payment of {$240.00} so both accounts would - today - be at a XXXX balance. 

Bank of America said, OK, but it would take 1 or 2 billing cycles to do. I understand why this is, again, BofA 's business model it to take funds they are not entitiled to, invest them, and give them back at a future time, making money off the backs of innocent consumers. 

Nice scam, maybe BofA can give seminars on how to scam money."
159,"United Wholesale Mortgage keeps putting false forced-coverage on my property. 

This started since last year, XXXX I purchased homeowners insurance with XXXX XXXX XXXX for the property in XXXX. UWM told me that the coverage was insufficient. But the whole time, they insisted on me having to buy Wind Insurance. I am in Florida and I must have hurricane coverage, which I did have. But I never needed wind coverage. Although they cover the same things, one is required in the state of Florida ( hurricane ) and the other is not required, unless a property is on the coast ( which mine is not ). 

I reached out to UWM and I was instructed of the discrepancy. I was instructed to reach out to FEMA to get a Letter of Map Adjustment ( LOMA ) to remove the wind coverage. I reached out to FEMA but LOMA is only to remove flood insurance. I must have flood coverage because I am in a AE zone. I sent the letter along with transcript from FEMA about the misinformation. UW lied about receiving a letter from FEMA about wind adjustment. 

After all this back and forth, they purchased wind coverage on several occasions while I had a homeowners policy with hurricane. Up until the XXXX of XXXX of this year, I am threatened with a notice to purchase Wind coverage, all this while I have sufficient homeowners with hurricane coverage. 

UWMs unwillingness to revise the contract and insurance are causing me great stress and great imbalance on my escrow account. They render the house unaffordable. My mortgage was XXXX in XXXX, XXXX in XXXX, but is currently XXXX with the possibility of an additional XXXX per month. The monthly payment is projected to be XXXX starting in XXXX. I reached out on several occasions but they are unwilling to drop the unnecessary forced coverage, which is unlawful.

This practice hurts minority homeowners, and this is painful to imagine that a services is operating outside of the legal realm because of little oversight."

I tried entering the amount on the screen. The screen was frozen. The Atm then went into restart mode. It never returned my money or the debit card. It did give me a receipt stating that my deposit must be verified. I took pictures of the screen also. I immediately called Wells Fargo Customer service with the phone number on my account business debit card. I explained to the customer service representative that I was depositing funds for my mortgage payment. I had already made my mortgage payment to XXXX XXXX  by check for {$1700.00}. I had cashed a check with XXXX XXXX  XXXX for {$1800.00}. The {$800.00} was the first portion of an {$1800.00} deposit. All banks are within a mile radius of each other.

I explained none of this seemed fair so she escalated it to a leader.

Using Synchrony cards everyday since 2016 and pay full balance every month. 
-I never had any late payment with Synchrony or any other bank card, loans etc. Everything is on time. 
-I have a very clear credit report with only % 8 utilization that are always paid in full every month. 

2 days ago I woke up with bunch of emails. Synchrony closed all of my accounts for nothing. Called customer service and they were even confused why it is happened.

Amazon store card {$590.00} balance of {$20000.00} limit. 

Paypal Mastercard {$350.00} balance of {$20000.00} limit.

When you settle an account, you negotiate a lump-sum payment with your lender to pay back part of what you owe so that the rest is forgiven. '' For those balances statement not even closed yet. I did not even get the statements to pay the balances.

-I never wanted to close the accounts.

-I never attempted to not pay the balances or never attempted to negotiate for settlement. 

I always pay the full amount after they send me the statement. 

I really need an assist with this situation since it damaged my credit score so bad. I'm in the middle of renting a house and I can't right now. 
I've never ever experienced anything like this before. 

Thank you."

170,"RE : CASE NUMBER XXXX Wells Fargo mortgage continuously miscalculated fees and other charges in my Escrow account. When I requested correction of these errors, Wells Fargo mortgage responded first by generating two incorrect foreclosure letters among other tailored documents to justify misappropriating funds in my escrow account, then refused to directly address issues raised.

173,"I am writing to express my deep concerns about the predatory practices and poor customer service that I have experienced with your company. Based on my personal experience and research, it is clear that your company intentionally makes it difficult for borrowers to access their account information, apply for loan modifications or refinancing, and receive accurate and timely responses to their inquiries. 

Specifically, I was locked into a high interest variable rate loan and given false information on repayment options. I have also experienced unresponsiveness from your representatives and received conflicting or misleading information when trying to seek help. This has left me feeling frustrated and hopeless about my ability to repay my loans. 

Furthermore, I am aware of the several legal cases and investigations brought against your company, including the 2014 lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and lawsuits from several state attorneys general. These allegations of excessive fees, misleading information about loan terms and options, and failure to properly process payments are deeply troubling. 

It is unacceptable that XXXX and innocent borrowers like myself are being taken advantage of by predatory practices. I urge your company to take immediate action to address these issues and provide better customer service to borrowers who are struggling to repay their loans. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter."

176,"I am filling this compliant regarding Citibank closed my saving account and refused to send me the funds remaining in my account. 

I opened a new Citibank Accelerate Saving account back in XXXX and successfully deposited $ XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX from my XXXX XXXX XXXX  saving account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Citibank that my account will be closed within 60 days. The email simply states : Based on a recent review of your account, we found that you have violated the terms per the client manual. There were no specifics given in the email as to what terms exactly I violated. I contacted Citi twice on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, both Citi representatives quoted the same statement in the email without adequate explanation why the account is closed. When I asked them how to get the remaining funds back, they said I will be receiving an mail with detailed statement and a check of the remaining balance, which is around {$15000.00}. 

Ok, no problem. But after patiently waited for 2 months, I still have not received anything from Citibank as of XX/XX/XXXX, so I called them again and this time they told me I will not be getting a check of the remaining balanced on my closed account. Instead, they asked to me contact XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX where the funds originally came from, and they need XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to file a Hold Harmless Claim and return the remaining balance to the original account. Again, there were no explanation from Citi representatives as to why they can`t just return the remaining funds to me, which is legit deposit from my funds in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Anyways, I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX  for this request of filing Hold harmless claim. After talking to 5 different agents in XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX claim department, which took me almost 4 hours. I got the same answer from them that XXXX XXXX XXXX can not file a Hold Harmless claim for the XXXX XXXX fund transfer to Citibank, because the fund transfer was totally legit and no implication of fraud, it was made by myself and was successfully deposited to Citibank account. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX states that Citibank should return the remaining funds directly to me, because it`s my money in Citibank account. If Citibank suspects any fraud involved in this transfer, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX expects Citibank to contact their fraud department and provided a contact email address. 

In the following days, I made numerous calls to Citibank again, informed them of the response I received from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, but all in vain. Citibank refused to contacXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX fraud department to request a claim, and Citibank Deposit Risk team still insists XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to contact them to file a Hold Harmless Claim for a legit funds transfer from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX perspective. Citibank again refused to return my funds back to me on the closed account. 

As a consumer, I`ve done my due diligence and spent tons of hours working with Citibank trying to get my money back, but ended up being putting into a hopeless position by Citibank where I run out of ideas how to get my {$15000.00} funds back. Citibank closed my account and hold account balance since XX/XX/XXXX with no reasonable explanation, and made the process impossible for a consumer to get their legit hard-earned money back. I sincerely hope CFPB can help in this situation with Citibank and and get my funds back.

I agreed based on this information. 

The truth is that this was not an accurate statement. So, my credit was dinged by Bank of America for opening a new card. I complained several times to the company. Bank of America offered to close the account- which I understood would ding my credit again, and they agreed that it would happen if they closed the account. But they never provided anything other than we are sorry and will talk to the employee who did this and said these things. 

This still infuriates me as I relied to my detriment on BOA 's representation that I would be able to have 0 % interest on my balance for 18 months. At no time has this happened. 

This is flat out fraud, and I advised them of this. I even called the fraud line for BOA and the only recourse they had was to close the account, which, again, would hurt my credit score. It did not occur to me until today that I could file a complaint with Consumer Protection. 

I believe this is standard practice for BOA to get as many credit cards out to people as possible. I would like BOA to have consequences for their agent's/employees behavior."

I was informed that I have to pay off the entire transfer and then the new purchases to avoid any interest on my new purchases. I was told that was in the very long disclosure.

Never got an answer and that phone call turned into what seemed like an intentional game of phone tag that ended with an email advise if she RESENT THE APPLICATION. I went to XXXX where the incompetence continued. They asked how I would like to be contacted by phone or email and I provided TWO EMAIL addresses. Didnt hear anything for a few days and reached back out and was advised THEY CALLED but got no answer- like it was my fault yet I NEVER PROVIDED A NUMBER. WE ARE AT A LOSS.

US BANK Lawyers has illegally transfered the court case where they can be favored. 

US BANK MORTGAGE buying mortgages and foreclosing on homeowners who are actually the righful owner of their home. 

Homeowners are protected under the consumer law .Its illegal for any Banks to foreclose on anybody 's home."
204,"I am writing to bring to your attention a matter of concern regarding the reporting of late payments to credit bureaus during the active period of the Heroes Act. 

According to Section 110401 of the Heroes Act, it clearly states that negative consumer credit reporting is suspended for an additional 120 days during this challenging time. 

Unfortunately, I have recently discovered that Freedom Mortgage Corp has reported late payments to credit bureaus in XXXX  despite the Heroes Act being in effect during the specified period. This action appears to be in direct violation of the protective measures outlined in the legislation. Reporting late payments during the active period of the Heroes Act contradicts the spirit and intent of this crucial consumer protection. 

I request that Freedom Mortgage cease reporting the unvalidated 30 day late payments promptly."

He says he does not know why he can not provide the info since its right in front of him & available. Instead im told to drive an hour north to the dealership i leased it from.

207,"I applied for a loan and did not see the terms when I applied and signed electronically and did not realize the company was a predatory lender. I borrowed {$1500.00} and when they continued to withdraw money to the amount of {$2600.00}, far beyond what I had borrowed, I called the company and was told the interest is 730 % and the interest on the loan is {$6500.00} and still owed {$5300.00}. I thought this kind of predatory lending was against the law. After finally receiving the terms it states the lender is a XXXX XXXX  and doesn't have to adhere to Federal laws.

Wells Fargo would not return our calls while we awaited anxiously as public school teachers with little money as the State of North Carolina did not give my wife and I ( both teachers at the time ) a cost of living raise for 7 years. 
Ultimately Wells Fargo foreclosed on our home before any attempt to help reduce our payments after being in the home about 10 years."
210,"I applied to Bethpage credit union for a line of credit. I could not get into sign documents. I emailed them 3 times about this. No reply. So I never signed the documents, yet they somehow checked my credit report, with no written authorization. We could not come to an agreement on a payoff item. So I ended up canceling my request. They wanted me to pay at at closing an unsecured loan that was at least 2.5 point lower then their rate, and would not substitute payments to Higher rate credit cards. no I worry that they would say denied when it was I who cancelled. And how do you check credit, which was good anyway, before you get authorization. I found their behavior very unprofessional. people should be aware of how they operate."
211,"Complaint Details During the pandemic, Freedom Mortgage offered a program forbearance. We applied for the program because my wife has her own business that closed temporarily due to the population she works with. This was a huge loss for us. When the Forbearance was completed we were told that we had to pay the entire amount of the forbearance back in XXXX lump sum. We were put into loss mitigation. Then we told we had to make payments on the XXXX  of every month for XXXX months to have the ability to pay on line, which we did. Freedom Mortgage sent out a new payment packet via XXXX XXXX and they put the package in our front door. We were never told it was sent. We do not use our front door and we didn't know it was there until we received a letter stating it was null and void because we didn't return it. I asked to have it sent again. I was told had to start over and fill out all of the paperwork for loss mitigation. After filling out all of the paperwork, we were told we were not in compliance with the submission of a completed loss mitigation packet despite doing so. I filled it out again and sent it. At the end of the time period we were then told that it was never submitted because it was incomplete. Upon filing it again we were always told a different story as to what was missing I then was told that it wasn't right and that they needed something else. I have been given a direct contact name that you can not reach. I have asked them to contact me directly by phone, they have not. I have called in many times to make payments and ask questions and have been told different things by their customer service. I am once again being asked to send in different documentation. I have all of the emails, paperwork saved."
212,"My family is in the beginning stages of foreclosure because we experienced financial hardship during XXXX and our mortgage company Select Portfolio Servicing has not offered any realistic type of help or forbearance or modification so that we can resolve the missed payments. We BUILT this house in XXXX and obtained financing through XXXX  XXXX XXXX backed by XXXX XXXX in XXXX. We always paid as agreed until we started a new garbage business and due to bad economy and cancelled contracts were forced to apply for loan modification in XXXX. We are grateful that we received help at that time and continued to pay as agreed until we had multiple issues due to XXXX and instead of helping us through the government CARES program or offering any type of assistance SPS closed the door and put us into foreclosure. If we had not been impacted by the pandemic this would not have happened and we should be offered affordable options to resolve our loan delinquency. 
Due to failing business we applied for HAMP modification through Seterus who handled our loan at the time and after long review were offered a step modification with rate now at 3.5 % and they deferred the missed payments.

( this was a XXXX XXXX XXXXoan and the guidelines for the program state that the servicer is REQUIRED by government mandate to offer us the CARES program which would allow us to skip 6-12 mortgage payments ). In that same period my husband hurt his back and once again had to miss work and now we were unable to make our mortgage payments and reached out to SPS for help. XXXX works as a lineman for an electric company and with my XXXX benefit we have sufficient income to afford a reasonable payment, we just needed help with the missed payments due to our XXXX  related issues. We were told to apply for a loan modification and I filled out the paperwork and sent it in, only to be told that we were denied because we had received a modification 6 years previous and that the investor does not offer more than one modification. 
I do not believe this is true, if XXXX XXXX still backs this loan there should be other options. If the investor has changed we would like SPS to provide documentation relating to the transfer of the mortgage loan from XXXX XXXX to the new investor as well as a copy of the loan modification guidelines for the investor a copy of the pooling and servicing agreement. SPS was required to offer us assistance options due to XXXX and we don't believe any existing investor guidelines apply when my state declares my county a disaster. 
We then received an offer for a repayment plan with 12 monthly payments of {$2600.00} which would get our account caught back up. 
sps did not review our income for this plan. The paperwork was received in early XXXX and the first payment of {$2600.00} was due on XX/XX/XXXX and we were still recovering from financial/health issues and unable to make the payment until XX/XX/XXXX but the payment was sent back by SPS. Our bank tried to resubmit the payment on XX/XX/XXXX but again it was rejected. When I called in to get information on what had happened they said that we had been kicked out of the repayment plan program because we missed the payment due date and there was no grace period. In XXXX SPS drafted our normal mortgage payment of {$1900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, but when we tried to pay in XXXX they refused to accept and said they were starting the foreclosure process."

I then went to XXXX to file a complaint against the company ( XXXX ) only to find that they are not XXXX affiliates. While on the XXXX website, I found a judgement against NationStar, signed by the judge on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 
My complaint centers on three aspects : 1 ) as a former NationStar customer, how do I receive my portion of the XXXX XXXX adjudication against them? 
2 ) why are these mortgage companies allowed to make it more difficult for the customer by creating their shell company subsidiaries? 
3 ) Nation Star, Mr. Cooper, and XXXX are, in reality, the same corporation and their business practices impair the customer, and that is not good business!

220,"I am writing to file a formal complaint against Freedom Mortgage Corporation ( "" Freedom Mortgage '' ), a mortgage servicing company that I currently have my home loan with for the above mentioned legal address and loan number. On XX/XX/, I submitted a letter of complaint to Freedom Mortgage via their online service portal, detailing my dissatisfaction with their service and the issues I have experienced with their escrow department. However, in a call I had with a representative named "" XXXX '' in their escalations team, I was informed that they were not handling my complaint and did not know where it was. As a result, I sent the same letter to their email on XX/XX/, and have not received any acknowledgement of receipt or response as of the date of this letter. 

In the aforementioned letter to Freedom Mortgage, I expressed my disappointment with their service and the trouble I have had with their escrow department, including an erroneous escrow surplus check I received in XX/XX/, an escrow shortage notice I received in XX/XX/, and the misapplication of my extra payments to my loan principal. Despite numerous phone calls and requests for an explanation, I have not received a satisfactory resolution to these issues, and I am deeply concerned about the handling of my escrow account. 

Furthermore, on XX/XX/, I also requested to have a copy of my loan agreement sent to me, but as of this writing, I have not received it. This lack of response and unresponsiveness is unacceptable and only adds to the growing list of issues I have had with Freedom Mortgage. 

I am seeking the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions in resolving these issues and holding Freedom Mortgage accountable for their poor service. As a borrower, I have the right to be treated fairly and with respect, and I believe that Freedom Mortgage has violated these rights by their handling of my account. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I have enclosed a copy of my original letter to Freedom Mortgage for your review, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Below is the body of the letter I submitted on the Freedom Mortgage online service portal. This letter was also emailed to a member of the Freedom Mortgage Escalation team.

To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the service I have received from Freedom Mortgage. I have been a customer of your company for several years now, and I have never experienced such frustration and inconvenience as I have with your escrow department. In XXXX of this year, I received a check for {$680.00} from your escrow department, which was supposed to be a surplus because your department had determined that my real estate taxes were only {$80.00}. However, in XXXX, I received another letter from your company informing me of an escrow shortage of {$890.00}. When I called customer service to inquire about this, I was told to mail a check for the shortage amount and mark in the memo "" for escrow account, '' which I did promptly. The check was cashed by your organization on XX/XX/. Since then, I have made two extra payments of {$1000.00}, but your company has not corrected my payment and has not applied the proper curtailments to my loan principal as expected. Instead, I am still being charged {$1000.00} as a payment. I demand that you fix my escrow account immediately. Furthermore, I was misled by your company this year, and I feel that my rights as a borrower under the Dodd Frank Act have been violated. I demand that you retroactively pay my curtailment principal for the months of XXXX and XX/XX/2023 rather than apply the curtailment for this month, since your company did not properly apply my escrow payment on XX/XX/2023. I do not believe the Freedom Mortgage Escrow and Customer Service representives are properly trained in handling my requests over the phone, as every time I call in, they try to peddle me to another department or ask that I submit an online request. I have spent countless hours on the phone with your representives trying to resolve this issue, and I am tired of the inconvenience and frustration that your company has served me. As a result, I do not wish to speak over the phone with any representatives of Freedom Mortgage. Instead, I request that you communicate your action plan to fix your mistake through my email at XXXX. I believe that this will allow for a more efficient and effective communication process and will help to resolve this matter in a timely and satisfactory manner. I understand that your company is the largest provider of VA loans, but I feel that my business has been reduced to just a number to you. I hope that you will take my concerns seriously and take the necessary steps to correct this situation promptly. 
Lastly, I want to express that if your company can not find the time, or competence, to correct your Escrow department 's errors when I make the XX/XX/2023 payment, I will have no choice but to pursue complaints with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions. As a customer, I expect to receive proper and fair treatment from my mortgage company. If your company is unable or unwilling to provide that, I will have no other recourse but to escalate my complaints to the proper regulators. 
This letter is being submitted online through the Freedom Mortgage online customer service portal on freedommortgage.com. I hereby certify that the above information is accurate and truthful to the best of my knowledge. This letter serves as a legal document and a formal notice of my dissatisfaction with the service provided by your company. I reserve all rights to pursue legal action and/or file a complaint with the appropriate regulatory agencies if this matter is not resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner."

This all now has resulted in a {$20.00} late payment fee to Flagstar. I am now unable to find any support contact information on their website. They have also failed to contact me via phone or email on the matter, I just have to keep checking and have received letters a week or more after the fact. 

I have had no problems with XXXX, my previous loan servicer. As a result of Flagstar 's terrible systems and support I'm now paying additional fees, wasting huge amounts of time and possibly damaging my credit."

Also that they can not look my information up to see what is happening because my loans are not with them. They tell me to call my XXXX XXXX, but my loan servicer sends me back to them because they say that they are not facilitating the XXXX program. I am getting the run around both ways."

I have since sold my vehicle and the party that it was sold to will not release funds until they have the title. 

This process has caused hardships for me since I cleared out my savings to payoff the balance and sell the vehicle. 

I am also requesting that VW pays me back for the last 2 months of payments due to this issue. I have also called VW and they told me that they are backed up with title issues and they can no do anything about it. That seems unfair to me since they already have taken my money and I do not have the title."
227,"During the Summer of 2022 due to hardship, I reached out to TitleMax for a loan on my car. I did not know this would turn into a nightmare.

I reached out to TitleMax to inform them that I could no longer afford the payment and as always each time I have a question or a concern, I was informed that "" you signed it or you agreed to it. '' On XX/XX/2022, I informed TitleMax that I was going to surrender the car and went in that day. The document that I had planned to sign was already pre-signed and dated by TitleMax. I informed TitleMax that I needed to read the document before I sign it. I decided not to sign the document because TitleMax wanted me to agree to a payment amount without knowing what that amount was going to be. 

On XX/XX/2022, I received a call from TitleMax regarding payment. I asked if I could get a copy of the document I signed. I was informed that it was against their policy to give me a copy of the document. I then asked if I could get a copy of their policy stating that and I was told that it was against their policy to give me a copy of their policy."

I requested this error to be corrected. Then she HUNG UP. This is ridiculous. XXXX has tried to raise the mortgage every month since I closed. 
Before I closed the loan EVERYONE was available, kind and very professional. Now NO ONE will assist me. I have taken my account from autopay and now I have to incur and expense for legal representation. This is simply horrible."

An online portal using Affirm subsidiary, XXXX XXXX, allowed this loan to go through. I have disputed this with Affirm/XXXX XXXX as well as XXXX and am awaiting resolution."
231,"Fulton bank continues to reverse or not register my payments within there "" system '' I have been dealing with this issue for a year. It feels like they are trying to foreclose on the house or pile on late fees. The worst part is that my wife and I are financially secure. We have no problems coming up with the money to pay our mortgage. The problems with payment occur on their end. I am honestly clueless as to why the payments get reversed or register on the account but, Fulton bank still says I am past due on the website. I speak so much with the employee in charge of my account, I recognize her voice. The issues has been going on since the account was opened in XX/XX/XXXX. Judging by a Fulton bank employee 's response today, this is a recurring theme. 

It still says that I am past due on my payments from XX/XX/XXXX however, I have made consistent payments. Today I got a letter in the mail making it seem like my account is delinquent. They are either doing some shady stuff over there or just negligent incompetence.

232,"Due to Navy Federal sluggish response and reluctant to provide in writing outstanding documents needed to process my mortgage loan in a timely manner I incurred additional cost. The appraisal was received on XXXX, while a request for renovated garage documentation was received on XXXX. A total of 5 Business Days after the appraisal was received and uploaded to my file. I then requested that underwriting decision be provided in writing as a disclosure so I can forward the request to a third party ( seller ). It took Navy Federal an additional 5 Business Days to provide a denial in writing showing the loan was not approval based on collateral. Once the loan was denied on XXXX, the seller amended the purchase contract and proceeded with obtaining a permit for the renovated garage. I called and left a message with mortgage banker on XXXX for appeal process. Also called the contact center an additional two times on XXXX for any information on the appeal process. Mortgage banker returned my call on XXXX, at that time forward the amended purchase contract and confirmation of the permit application in process on XXXX. Mortgage banker called with update on XXXX that a written XXXX  for a appeal is needed to move forwarded. Email XXXX provided on XXXX.Appeal was accepted on XXXX and loan sent for Final Review on XXXX XXXX received on XXXX, final cd and closing instructions sent to title on XXXX. Final CD disclosed at XXXX on XXXX for closing on XXXX. As evident in the timeline, all request were received from me in a timely manner. While on multiple occasions Navy Federal took several business days that wasted valuable time."
233,"I obtained a loan from Planet Home Lending on XX/XX/XXXX. My insurance agent provided Homeowner 's insurance and Flood insurance quotes and the premiums were paid during closing. 
Problem # 1 = insurance information was never updated on the portal! 

A bit later I found out that Planet Home Lending decided that the property was in zone A ( though FEMA map shows it in zone X ) and requested my insurance agent to find the quote for zone A and additional funds were disbursed to pay higher insurance. 
Problem # 2 = I was not informed, not a single letter, email, etc. All of this was done behind my back and my insurance agent told me that Planet Home Lending assured them that I was aware. 
Problem # 3 - FEMA shows that the property is located in zone X and the original flood insurance I had was sufficient to cover for flood insurance. 

in XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Planet Home Lending informing me that I did not have an active flood insurance and that I needed to get one, otherwise PHL would purchase an expensive one for me. That sounded like a fraudulent scheme ( similar to the ones other consumers suffered from based on multiple complaints found on the web ), how can the same company who requested to charge more money for the existing flood insurance now XXXX months later tell me that I did not have any flood insurance? 
when I received that letter, I uploaded proof of insurance to the portal address provided and sent a paper copy proof for homeowners and flood insurances to the address provided in the letter. 
in XX/XX/XXXX I found out that Planet Home Lending fraudulently charged me for the second flood insurance {$2200.00}. In addition Planet Home Lending is planning to charge me additional {$370.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  insurance on XX/XX/XXXX, which is the second XXXX insurance on the same property, this looks like an attempt to fraudulently use my escrow funds to purchase additional insurances not required by law."
234,"XXXX XXXX, 2023 : I ( complainant ) contacted Bank of America ( BOA ) for a pre-approval letter for a mortage. I spoke with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX : XXXX ). 

XXXX XXXX, 2023 : Complainant submitted all information for pre-approval process via the BOA online portal. This included assets, income, and demographic information requested. 

XXXX XXXX, 2023 : Was made aware that based on the information provided in the pre-approval loan application that we were not eligible for the intended program ( for XXXX and XXXX communities ) based on one of the credit scores of one of the applicants. XXXX from BOA informed us of another option, which was the XXXX XXXX XXXX program that we would qualify for based on the information provided. This program required us to take a five hour class, submit a monthly budget to a HUD counselor, and have a counseling call to discuss the feasibility of purchasing a home with that counselor. Because this was our only option, we agreed. 

XXXX XXXX, 2023 : XXXX forwarded us a list of approved providers in the XXXX area and we signed up for a HUD Class through XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. Needed to re-arrange our schedule and get pre-approved time off work because of the timing of the class. 

XX/XX/2023 : Both my significant other and I took the 5 hour class via zoom. We received certificates of completion the next day from XXXX XXXX  XXXX and were instructed to sign up for a counseling session with a HUD counselor. Before scheduling the session, we needed to submit a monthly budget and authorization forms for our credit to be pulled and discussed to during the meeting. All of which we did. 

XX/XX/2023 : Completed the counseling session with XXXX XXXX ( HUD Counselor ). During this session, XXXX did not express any concerns about my credit report or anything noted in it. We went through the XXXX open accounts. XXXX, did however, express concern for two of the items on my partners credit report. He stated that he would not be able to provide a certificate of completion for the program until we took care of both of those issues with XXXX and XXXX. 

XX/XX/2023 : As instructed, we paid off over {$20000.00} in debt from XXXX XXXX XXXX years ago and sent the proof over to XXXX. XXXX then provided us with certificates from HUD for completing the program, as instructed, so that it could be used for pre-approval in our home buying process. 

XX/XX/2023 : I submitted our certificates of completion to XXXX from BOA via email to review. 

XX/XX/2023 : XXXX informed me that between my partner and I, we made too much money to qualify for the program he originally pointed us to ( something he knew from the beginning by having access to our application ). Frustrated, I asked about other options and he stated that because of the amount of money that I take home, we could try getting pre-approved with just me. I asked to move forward with that process. 

XX/XX/2023 : XXXX informed me that the late 30-day and 60-day late payment on my account from XXXX XXXX is a deterrent for approval. I then informed him that the payment was late because I was in and out of the hospital and XXXX, so was not able to pay any of my bills. He said he would submit to a senior manager for review and an exception. He did not take any other additional information at that time ( no dates of XXXX medical bills, decreased income based on medical issues, etc. ) XX/XX/2023 : XXXX called me to inform me that the Senior Manager did not approve my request. He stated that we could send the information to the underwriter for review but it would take about XXXX - XXXX weeks. Based on the information we were given, we started the process a month before we needed an answer, and we don't have two weeks because we need to give our current landlord a 60-day notice to vacate because our lease is up XX/XX/XXXX. 

My issues are as follows : - Lack of training on the end of BOA. XXXX had our information from the beginning, and since we did not qualify for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, we never should have been pointed in that direction, and were given incorrect information. 
- There is MAJOR disconnect between HUD and BOA for a program they claim helps disenfranchised people get into homes. Our HUD counselor saw no issue with my late payment, which I spent over an hour going through the same credit report that BOA is using.

- No clear process. There is no clear process laid out for the programs available, only further disenfranchising people that are already marginalized. We spent XXXX hours, took time off work, and paid over {$2000.00} in debt, all in the name of some arbitrary process is unclear and mucky at best. 

BOA is taking advantage of people, not training their staff properly, mis-leading customers in a way that is causing future financial harm. Their business practices are causing inequity amongst disenfranchised people and their lack of clarity regarding their process in causing customers to be treated unfairly."
235,"I refinanced my home XX/XX/XXXX. The closing attorney sent the funds to XXXX XXXX  who our mortgage was with. During the days of closing on our refinance with XXXX XXXX and the attorney sending the funds, XXXX sold our mortgage off to Mr Cooper. The closing attorney sent funds to XXXX who in return wired the money to Mr Cooper. The day I asked for a wire tracking number, XXXX was able to provide me one. XXXX wired the funds to Mr Cooper on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX forwarded me this email Payoff Statement Quote : XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX Per diem XXXX Wire Received XXXX on XXXX at XXXX Difference : XXXX / XXXX = 4 days less than the quote. 
Good through XXXX minus 4 days allows for XX/XX/XXXX as a posting date. 

Mr. Cooper claims the funds were short and sent the money back on XX/XX/XXXX. I haver called Mr Cooper multiple times asking for a wire tracking number. Mr Cooper told me they wired the funds to the closing attorney, I called the attorney and they confirmed they have not received them. I had someone call and ask where the funds were sent and to check if they were sent to me or XXXX. I have not received the funds and neither has XXXX. Every time I call Mr Cooper and ask for a wire tracking number no one can provide me one and tell me someone from accounting will call me back and they never do. I call weekly ( 1-2 times per week ) and ask for a wire tracking number because no one can tell me where $ XXXX was sent. Now because the loan is considered in bad standing we have received letters from an attorney saying our home will be a foreclosure sale soon. Mr Cooper claims they have wired money and can not provide a wire tracking number, nor can their employees tell me where the money was sent. They asked me if I knew where it was or told me it was sent to places and it hasn't been sent. So either they haven't sent the money like they claim they have or they have wired $ XXXX to someone and they have no clue of who they sent it to. I don't understand how in todays age of technology no one at this company can tell me where this money was sent or provide me with a tracking number and I am continuing to get threatened with a foreclosure."
236,"Purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX miles in XX/XX/XXXX at {$19000.00}. We tried returning the car less then 7 days later due to not a car for us as a family. We were told we had to make payments on the car first and try to trade it in after. We drove the car less then 800 miles and the clutch failed. The dealer wanted to charge {$4000.00} to have the clutch fixed. Came back to trade it in and was told we need to make more payments before they will trade it in. The dealer should of have replaced the clutch before we bought the car since it was past the 100,000 miles marker. We have had our credit run again by the dealer when we didn't have an reason to wince there was nothing happening."
237,In XXXX I started receiving a ton of emails and calls about loans I applied for. I did not apply for any loans. XXXX informed me my info was shared on the dark web.

238,"Hurricane Ian, XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, UWM gave us a 3 month forbearance plan to add the mortgage payments to the end of our mortgage. This was extended an additional 3 months to begin XX/XX/XXXX. After the plan was coming to an end in XX/XX/XXXX, UWM sold the mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and would no longer be able to help with our repayment plan as promised. We called UWM multiple times talking to XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX. All of these discussions nothing was talked about except adding these 6 payments to the end of the mortgage and that we would be able to talk with UWM after the end. XX/XX/XXXX. 
UWM conveniently sold the mortgage XX/XX/XXXX. As a result of UWM not honoring what their representatives stated, we received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating that our loan is in default, and they want to foreclose on the mortgage instead of doing what UWM said they would do originally. 
I always made sure that UWM representatives understood that we wanted to add the payments to the end of our mortgage. We were never told anything about a possible foreclosure. 
We live on a very limited income and value our credit scores. I have been on XXXX and my wife is on social security income. This caused us to go out and get a loan to pay off the forbearance plan and get it up to date so we would NOT lose our home. 
Shame on you."
239,"I got my mobile home in 2019 and was making auto draft payments. Last XXXX my payments went up from {$460.00}?? to {$660.00} with no warning. I called and was told they paid my property tax and an estimated ins increase. I asked why, they hadn't paid the first XXXX years. Apparently I signed something at the beginning to ok them to pay. They had no explanation to why they didn't pay the first XXXX yrs. I was told my escrow was short. I asked how could that be with me paying in on the escrow for XXXX yrs and they hadn't paid the taxes, there should have been more than enough. They said I got a refund, which I did not. They refused to refinance, or take any late payments off, and I got a budget lecture and told me to tell my son to drop out of college to pay his own way. After several phone called I talked to a manager and explained I was a XXXX XXXX with XXXX in college and just barely getting by paying bills. She said to just pay a partial payment and that would keep me from loosing my house as long as I was paying on it. I received a letter saying I was in default from not paying in XXXX  months. I called yesterday and was told that I haven't paid in XXXX months so I was in default. I told them the dates of my payment ( which was from $ XXXX {$550.00} ). They told me my payment was applied, my next months payment went to the previous months balance, then the remaining balance went to the next month etc which put me in not paying for XXXX months. My credit and financial is hurt and I can't get a loan to refinance since I used credit cards to pay for groceries and gas trying to keep up. Not only did I not receive refunds, they did a few reversal payments with no explanation."
240,"On XX/XX/2023 PNC was notified that XXXX has pulled out of the state of Florida for home owners insurance. Despite them receiving a new policy to pay that I signed, they still paid XXXX a premium, for a policy I would have never had. They received a quote from XXXX insurance and paid that premium without my authorization. Then the insurance that I signed up for, they decided to pay them twice. All by the time it was XXXX. I received the check from XXXX and deposited it back into my PNC escrow account on XX/XX/XXXX, but they said it will not hit my account until XXXX. I found out about the additional payment to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2023. I had to speak to two people in the insurance department before someone would finally put a stop payment on the check since XXXX XXXX already cashed the first one and had not received it yet. That also will not hit my escrow account until XX/XX/XXXX. They have done absolutely nothing to fix this and put the entire responsibility on the consumerme. They then reported this to the Credit Bureau saying that I took money out on my home changing my total balance with them. Over {$13000.00} of a difference on the balance I owe on my home. This has dropped my credit score. I have to wait until XX/XX/XXXX to then have to call them, ask them to re-evaluate my escrow account. Once I do that, I then have to call the mortgage department for them to call the credit bureau and explain what happened to they can edit my credit score. PNC has made numerous payments on my behalf without my authorization. They were never going to fix this without me finding it. They were not authorized to change my balance. Then they wrongly charged me additionally for hazard insurance until I had to make them look at my insurance policy to find I did have hazard. At that time they had THREE policys on my account and still said I didnt have hazard insurance. PNC customer service is pointless. Their departments are pointless. They make massive mistakes and require their customers to do all the work for them to fix it."
241,"See attached letter from the sketchy business, in the letter the business lied and falsely claimed that I can easily make additional payments by simply calling in to customer service.

242,"Hello, I hope you are doing well today! 

I am writing because I am struggling to get any information from MOHELA about my attempt to enter the PSLF program. Under the extension which allowed PSLF applications last year, I put in a request to enter the program and have my service at several universities credited toward the length of service for loan forgiveness. This was some time in the Fall of last year, prior to the XXXX deadline. 

I eventually got a confirmation that my materials were received on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told at that time that I could expect more information within 90 days. 

Unfortunately, they have not been forthcoming with any information. At the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX, I had tried accessing their online system repeatedly, to no avail. I then tried to get the information over the phone and found myself faced with a frustrating automated system, which almost seemed to be engineered for the purpose of dissuading an individual from utilizing it. No matter the information I entered or words I said, I would get put into a loop where the system wanted to know what i was looking for, and then asked for identifying info- Which was unrecognized in each and every instance. Finally, after about 15 minutes of struggling with this automated system ( and attempting to trigger a transfer by using words such as "" Agent, '' "" Human, '' and "" Representative '' ), I was connected with someone. 

While the woman I spoke to was incredibly kind, it seemed that she did not have access to much information, or at the very least, was unwilling to divulge any to me. After providing her with my information she was able to find my request, and informed me that it was being held up for review. Upon asking what the review was for, she refused to provide any information. I asked how long I could expect this to take, and was told I should hear back within a couple of weeks. It has now been over a month and I have not heard from MOHELA. Their phone system remains a kafkaesque nightmare. I was apprehensive about even wasting my time on the PSLF, knowing that previous administrations defrauded those who applied through the program, and I am now wondering if I have wasted my time for nothing. I would be immensely appreciative of anything the CFPB could do to compel Mohela to at least give me some information on what is happening."

Rather than finding a way to work with us / taking responsibility for their own sloppy mistakes ( no notice served / incorrect address, broken agreements too many to count ). 

Negligence is one thing, but Im afraid thats not the case here.. the degree of their misconduct is troubling and they should be held responsible for their behavior. 

They have gone after me, my family and my home with malicious intent. 

Not willing to even PRETEND to try and work with us / offer a reasonable solution at any point of this nightmare. SLS abused their power as a financial institution to bully us into a corner Not only have they refused to work with us, but whats worse is how theyve gone out of their way to perpetuate lies. unjustly attacking us and going all in on defending their fraud and criminally behavior. They are undoubtedly doing all they can to cover tracks and escape the liability which inevitably will track them down. They can say whatever they please, Im here to defend the truth and it will prevail.

All of the forms submitted have all my employment history to certify my payments but they are not being reviewed, therefore, I still have payments that state they require "" employment certification ''. Which is incorrect because all the documentation needed has been submitted.

Yet they didn't change the amount of escrow they were holding back, they actually raised our monthly payment. We have repeatedly reached out via message, chat, and phone to try to work out the issue and get our payment to the correct amount. They have continually told us they are researching the issue and will get back to us by a certain date. Inevitably the date arrives, we reach out again and they push us off to a later date. It has now been 102 days with no resolution. They are reserving {$8200.00} in our escrow account for taxes, however our annual tax amount is {$3100.00}. Our monthly payment should be reduced by {$410.00} dollars.

When I ask for financial help with the company, I am denied half of the time because I havent paid enough on the car but Ive paid nearly my entire yearly salary since purchase. This is a scam."
258,I tried to negotiate a settlement offer with this company and they wouldnt go down more than XXXX dollars from a XXXX balance. Which is ridiculous to me. Thats not much of a negotiation. Now its constantly bringing down my credit.
259,"I missed a payment on my joint loan with my grandfather and it was illegally repossessed during the time that Wells Fargo was illegally performing repossessions on vehicles that should have never received that treatment in 2022, they repoed my vehicle without telling me, the XXXX, and my grandfather making it seem like my vehicle was just stolen, they also never returned my stuff that was left after the vehicle was sold."
260,"We chose to use Amerisave Mortgage Corporation for the purchase of our new home after they agreed to apply credits to our loan to decrease their loans fees in order to be competitive with our local bank. A credit in the amount of {$5200.00} was add as an "" other '' credit on the loan application that was prepared by Amerisave on XX/XX/2023 and further signed by an Amerisave agent ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/2023. Closing is scheduled for XX/XX/2023. On XX/XX/2023, we noticed that the credit had been removed. Our closing agent ( not associated with Amerisave ) noticed this as well and questioned Amerisave why this credit was removed. They ( XXXX & XXXX XXXX responded saying the credit was a glitch that should have been removed. On XX/XX/2023, I reached out to multiple parties ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ) at Amerisave explaining the origin of the credit and to explain that I have a copy of the document where the credit is itemized. The agent ( XXXX XXXX at Amerisave said they don't use the "" other '' credits category for anything other than earnest money deposits or realtor credits, so this never should have been there. The agent ( XXXX XXXX that offered the credits and added them to the loan no longer works for Amerisave, and they were not willing to check the recorded conversations. The Agent ( XXXX XXXX then stated that he reviewed all forms that were available to me, and no forms exist with the {$5200.00} credit listed. He then said, perhaps I was confused and should look at the forms again, and the number would probably change. XXXX further stated that Amerisave had already credited our loan in the amount of {$8000.00}, which he would provide info on. I explained that I would provide a copy of the document I had, which I printed from the Amerisave portal. XXXX then emailed acknowledging that he found the document I referred to but said the {$5200.00} credit was an error and should not have been included. XXXX said the {$8000.00} credit he mentioned would come from Box A of the disclosure or loan estimate, but no credit in the amount of {$8000.00} has ever been shown in XXXX XXXX of any documents provided to us. XXXX said, since Amerisave was offering a credit of {$8000.00}, and they supposedly applied a credit in the amount of {$8000.00}, it will show as "" XXXX ''. I again asked him to show me a document where the credit is shown and figured into the loan numbers. I also noted that this is a separate issue and still does not explain the removal of the {$5200.00} credit that was applied to earn our business. Amerisave has not responded since XX/XX/2023. They have not provided any proof of an {$8000.00} credit being applied to the loan, and the {$5200.00} credit has been removed causing us to owe an additional {$5200.00} at closing on XX/XX/2023. One other note, when speaking with XXXX at Amerisave, she said she understood the principle behind this and they would get the credits back. I have not heard anything further from XXXX. In closing, Amerisave promised {$5200.00} in lender credits at the inception of the loan but removed the credits days before closing causing us to owe {$5200.00} additional fees at closing."
261,I dont remember the exact date but it was XXXX I received a letter saying I was denied a personal loan that I never applied for I called and was told they didnt see anything in the system I feel like someone there ( wells Fargo ) attempted to get a loan and wasnt able to all my correct information was in the letter It looked like any other paperwork. When I called all the guy said was ignore it that it wasnt real and he didnt see it in the system which I feel it was deleted because I was denied and they knew the average person would call and ask about it.
262,Prosper when I originally talked on the phone didnt say the APR would be 17 % I have been struggling since they said it was around 12 %. Also I never signed anything to get the loan I applied and they gave it me right away so I didnt really have an option to back out. Plus they took another {$1500.00} dollar feel so gave me {$23000.00}. Overall I never wanted the loan and struggled to pay it back I wanted to see if I was approve but they gave it to me
263,I took out a loan thought Title Max was not aware I would end up in this situation. I originally took out the loan on my car to help with rent.

264,"Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a distressing situation involving a fraudulent contract that I was coerced into by XXXX XXXX XXXX and Road Auto Finance. I believe that my consumer rights have been violated, and I am seeking your assistance in resolving this matter. 

In the contract that was presented to me, I discovered several instances of false information, including incorrect names and fabricated down payment details. I want to clarify that I only provided a down payment of {$500.00} and entrusted the dealership to hold the car for me until I received my refund check. However, to my surprise, the dealership had already proceeded with the paperwork and submitted inaccurate information to Road Auto Finance, stating that I had made a down payment of {$2000.00}. Unfortunately, by that point, I felt compelled to proceed with the sale due to my vulnerable position and immediate need for transportation. 

Within the first week of acquiring the vehicle, I experienced multiple issues and promptly notified XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, he informed me that no repairs would be undertaken until I paid an additional {$1500.00}, threatening to withhold my tags unless I complied. Consequently, XXXX XXXX XXXX held my tags and forced me to visit the DMV to retrieve them. This situation has caused undue distress and financial burden. 

Moreover, after several months had passed, I contacted Road Auto Finance to explain the discrepancies in my transaction, including the misrepresented down payment and the incorrect names on the contract. I further expressed my concerns regarding the negative impact these inconsistencies had on my credit profile. Shockingly, XXXX XXXX from the legal department dismissed my concerns, stating that I should never have signed the contract and demanded immediate payment, or else they would repossess my vehicle. It is important to note that I was only eight days late with my payment, whereas repossession typically occurs after a period of 30 days or more. 

Furthermore, I have discovered that my personal information has been shared with a non-affiliated third party called XXXX XXXX XXXX without providing me with proper written notice. This breach of confidentiality has caused me extreme emotional, financial, and psychological distress, ultimately resulting in an alarming incident where a tow truck driver arrived at my residence in an aggressive manner, necessitating police intervention. Such actions are in clear violation of U.S.C. 15 1692f ( 6 ), which prohibits non-judicial actions that lead to dispossession or disablement of property when there is no intention to take possession. 

Additionally, I want to bring your attention to the dealership 's failure to disclose that the vehicle had undergone electrical repairs and had been flooded, causing long-term issues, including the malfunctioning of the horn. 

Given the severe distress caused by Road Auto Finance and the lack of resolution thus far, I am left with no choice but to consider reaching out to the Attorney Generals of Florida and Georgia, namely XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, respectively. I am also contemplating pursuing legal action through the small claims court if a resolution can not be reached. 

I kindly request that you investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action against XXXX XXXX XXXX and Road Auto Finance for their deceptive, abusive, and unfair practices, as outlined in 15 U.S.C. 1962. Additionally, I urge you to address the violation of 15 U.S.C. 6802, which pertains to the unauthorized sharing of my personal information with third parties without proper written notice. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your prompt response. Please find enclosed copies"

I have been contacted by Ally Financial, who alleges that I owe an outstanding balance. However, I believe that their claim is inaccurate and misleading.

267,I applied for an online installment loan. Was approved for up to {$1500.00} so it asks how much I pick {$1500.00}. Just trying to find out what my monthly payment would be what my interest rate would be and click continue without showing me any of that information it automatically tells me that the money has been funded still no information on monthly payment or interest. I'm immediately on XX/XX/XXXX right after it said it was funded I immediately contacted them telling them that I was not interested that I was just trying to get my quote for my interest rate and monthly payments. And now they charge me {$170.00} twice a month when I can't afford twice a month payment I'm on XXXX which is noted on the application the interest rate is astronomical but I still don't even know what it is because they never sent me that information or gave me an opportunity to review it.. I think they should have to lower my interest rate to what my States legal limit is because like I said I don't know what rate they gave me but it is astronomically High and should be illegal especially to not disclose it to somebody before they submit because even when I did click an area that might tell me what it would be it only gave me examples not what mine specifically would be. I think they should have to knock my interest rate down to at least 26 % that my state would allow. And also make my payments once a month instead of twice a month. They should also have to stop reporting it to my credit report because I did not agree on this loan overall they should just completely wipe the loan out because I never agreed on their terms they never showed me the terms I have a copy of their email responding to me that it had all been canceled and that I would not be charged anything I have that email

My application has been sent and received by Mohela XX/XX/XXXX. My direct student loans with XXXX have been transferred/consolidated at that time to Mohela as instructed.

278,"For background context, I recently had a serious medical/dental issue and needed to pay for a very expensive dental procedure. 

On XX/XX/2023, I called Truist to ask about a payment deferral to take care of my immediate medical expenses. I was told by the rep that I qualified, as I was in excellent standing and had had the loan for over a year. She told me to expect an email from Truist with my deferral agreement no later than XXXX XXXX Monday, XX/XX/2023, and to call back if I didnt receive it. As of XXXX XXXX Monday XX/XX/2023, I hadnt received the email, so I called back. I asked if it could be sent to me while I was on the phone so that I could verify if I got it. I was told no. I said okay, to be honest, if I didnt get the first one Im not sure Ill get the second one anyway, as this is clearly an issue with their email server. I asked if there was an alternate way to get the document- via fax or postal service. I was again told no. I asked why I couldnt just receive it in the mail and was told it had to expire, which made no sense considering I was asking for a different method. The rep refused to tell me how long it would take to expire and what my next steps should be. 

I hung up and called back, getting a different rep. This one talked over me, talked down to me, and would not let me ask a question. He kept repeating something along the lines of maam are you going to work with me as a team? Just repeatedly saying that over and over and refusing to allow me to get a word in or ask my questions. He finally said he could mail it, but would I be willing to wait ten days? I asked for some clarification on the ten days - did that mean I would receive it within ten days or did that mean I had to wait ten days and then call back to resubmit my request? He refused to answer the question and kept asking his working as a team question. I dont need to work as a team for these people ; they already are a team, and their job as a team is to assist me, which they did not. 

I ended up ending the call and was so upset over the incident I began to cry. I was trying to do a very simple thing and asking basic questions, and instead of being helped I was being spoken to like a bad child. I called back a third time and got a different rep who finally agreed to mail me the agreement. 

However, later on that night I went online and realized I could file a request there. I did so, which also raised a red flag. If they had actually processed my request, why did it not say it was already pending and not allow me to submit a new one? Less than 12 hours after submitting it, I got the email from the automated system - the automated system responded to my request better and faster than actual human beings. That is a serious flaw with Truist Bank."
279,"I would like to see them return my money and and pay off my car for asking for a down payment of XXXX and pressuring me to buy an extended warranty for XXXX. So a car that started off at XXXX ends up costing XXXX Which the car isnt even worth that much.

280,"I have submitted the request previously. Ally Financial was the loan company that financed the truck I purchased back in XXXX. I was very ill during the purchase and basically had no recollection of the purchase. I brought the truck back to the dealership because I could not afford what they had financed me for. Apparently they financed me for almost {$70000.00}. The sticker price of the truck was only {$56000.00}. They paid off my XXXX XXXX for {$13000.00} and tacked that onto my loan, financed me at 17.9 % and didn't give me any money for the XXXX. They in turn sold it for almost {$21000.00}. I would never agree to this kind of financing and do not know how I could get it being on XXXX. I am now reporting Ally Financial as they have given me a poor credit rating."
281,"I contacted Citizen about my loan XXXX prior to becoming delinquent on their account to communicate that I was experiencing hardship due to being laid off and that I wanted to know what options existed for someone in my position. The woman on the phone stated that there was nothing the company offered and that my only option was to submit a payment and stated more than once that there was no option for someone experiencing hardship. 

I called back after they'd reported my account as delinquent to see if I could just payoff the account and remove the negative reporting and the new representative stated that I received false information and that Citizen DID offer hardship options to people and that the representative I spoke to should have provided me with those options. Had I received those options, I am sure I could have prevented my account from becoming delinquent. 

Therefore, had I been given all of the information when I first called ( before I became delinquent ) I would not have had to go through the negative reporting. I was not given complete information, the first representative was lazy and unprofessional and as a result my credit report was impacted. I know all calls are recorded and the first call should be recorded, I want a supervisor or manager to listen to the first and second call so they can see how stark the differences are and I need an explanation as to why their representatives are not trained the same, and I need that negative reporting removed because I could have worked out an arrangement on the first call, BEFORE I WAS LATE, and prevented my credit score from being impacted."
282,"Mohela, according to the Mohela customer service rep I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX, explained that Mohela 's processing error led to a letter/notification that my employer did not complete questions 9-12 on the employer verification form that my employer submitted. She pulled up my materials and confirmed that my employer verification form was complete ( all required responses were provided along with appropriate signature ). 

The representative said that my application file ( including employer 's form and employer 's eligibility ) was complete and should cleared review. ' I was already past the 90-day period the Mohela site posted as my processing time, my application is complete ( according the representative who reviewed it with me during my call ), but the representative said that Mohela would reset my processing for another 90-day period to clear my application for approval. 

The representative did reset my application, which now shows that a new 90-day processing period has begun. Now a week later, I received a notification detailing that my payments will resume ( but I am way over the 120 payments for XXXX forgiveness ), Furthermore, the rep ( who was polite, no troubles there ) suggested that I resubmit my borrower 's page for the XXXX application, and noted that I should resign my signature on the original application page. I did as suggested ( see attached ) and now that submission is listed as resetting the 90-day processing for review. 

As the end of the federal forbearance period is coming soon, I am out of time with the uncertainty that additional Mohela reviewing errors will likely continue to reset and delay my approval. The Mohela employee reviewed all my materials while I was on the phone, and she clearly stated that all my materials were in order and that it was flagged in error and now must start the process from scratch. 

From consumer reports from CFPB, there is clearly a pattern of Mohela delays and errors that jeopardize timely and accurate review for official approval. 

If the rep I spoke with can confirm all my materials and information is in order, why am I back to square one, and why do I need to wait another 3+ months fearing that the error-prone review process will delay and disturb my official approval. 

I made more than 120 payments towards XXXX forgiveness. 
All forms ( including employer form from employer ) were submitted before the XX/XX/XXXX deadline. 
Mohela rep explained my files were complete and accurate, and that the application shouldn't have been flagged as having an error. 
Yet, I am now back to week 1 of another round of 90-days for processing, in the same exact system that erroneously flagged my application after the previous 90-day review period."
283,"On XX/XX/XXXX2021, I was told that I needed to pay XXXX as a down payment on a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was also told that I had to have full coverage insurance on the vehicle before I can leave. I have reason to believe that the lender ( Global Lending Services ) willingly and knowingly took advantage of me and my consumer credit. Within the contact I found at least 10 consumer law violations."
284,"I applied for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and was informed that there was a 90 day processing time. The 90 day period has now passed and when I logged in to check the status of my application the status showed "" Cancelled ''. I have not received any correspondence regarding this and have not been informed of what "" cancelled '' indicates/translates. Upon contacting Mohela by phone on XX/XX/XXXX I was placed on a significantly long hold while my application status was "" looked into '' and still was not provided with helpful information or resolution during the phone call. At conclusion of this call I was told that I would need to wait another 30 days for processing as they are unsure of why my application status is showing as cancelled. I submitted all required and fully completed documentation in XXXX of XXXX and I am not sure what the hold up is for moving forward with the forgiveness of my student loans on the basis of 120 months of completed public service. Being that the 90 days has passed I feel correction or further processing of my application should now be expedited and I should not be required to wait another 30 days due to MOHELA mishandling of my application."
285,As I'm attempting to pay down my car loan I've noticed that there's no way to apply an extra payment to principal only. Wells Fargo continues to apply this to interest and fees. I am currently 3 months ahead on my payments and no matter what when I apply an extra payment it continues to apply a certain amount to the interest despite being ahead. The only way to apply additional payments to principal is to add it on to an automatic pay option. There are even fees that are being paid that I don't understand or can not tell what they are. I'm not certain why I have to pay future interest that hasn't yet occurred. For example if I pay off my car now then I would have paid interest that never would have existed increasing the overall cost of the car.
286,"Mohela has been unresponsive to my questions about my account. They have also changed so-called "" policies and procedures '' throughout my interaction with them over the past 5 months. I applied for public service loan forgiveness in XXXX of XXXX. I was told it could take up to 90 days. In XXXX, I received two notices. The first was an update showing that my certification had been updated. And the second stating they had. These were very confusing because although they were transmitted electronically they appeared to back dated and was challenging to piece together which notice was correct. Since then, I have been told there's no other paperwork I need to file and my account reveals the necessary number of qualifying payments. However, I have not been able to confirm whether Mohela has taken any next steps to contact the Department of Education so that my loans can be discharged. I have called multiple times and received no answers. Most recently I called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX who only spoke to me vague generalities about how the process works and would not answer my questions about my account. He promised to transfer me to a supervisor but after 30 minutes on hold they hung up and never called back as promised. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to utilize the chat function where I spoke with XXXX. Again, she only spoke in vague generalities and when I continued to ask questions specific to my account she told me I could call to speak to a supervisor and then blocked me from continuing the chat. The other complication is that when I call and use the directory it suggests that there has been another document uploaded to my account in XXXX that I can not see online and that I did not personal submit. I don't know what else to do in order to get information relative to my own personal account. This is completely unacceptable."

My intent was to complete the purchase entirely online with XXXX XXXX once a pre purchase inspection was completed. I have text messages stating this and assuring me my credit would not be run and I had to fill out the application for identity purposes. As soon as I submitted the application my credit was run through multiple lenders at least 5! Despite my pre-approval and the assurance that it would not be run. I am requesting these inquiries be removed from my report as they were not authorized and impacting my credit score. I ended up not purchasing the vehicle as it did not pass the independent inspection I had performed.

This started on XX/XX/XXXX ( initial claim date ). This was nearly a month after trying to start the claim. The car was XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX.

I called today XXXX days after payment and was told that when customers pay off the loan they are put on a waiting list to receive their funds. This process takes XXXX days is what I was advised. Besides the fact that the company charged interest on money never received during the loan process and now holding the money after loan is paid off with no interest paid to me the customer who has had a savings account that actually lost money.

I called in Discover on XX/XX/ to check the health status of the account and they did confirm that the account is in order. I logged into the student portal to gather more information about the loan such as an amortization statement as the he has about {$53000.00} in loan for a fixed term of 15 years. However, the Discover Student portal has no information whatsoever about the amortization statement relating the the forecast of the loan spread over 15 year period. There is no clear break up of interest versus principal. I spoke to two representatives today. The first rep put me on a long hold and disconnected the call. The second representative was more forthcoming and confirmed that there is no such statement such as amortization for student loan and he put me on hold. The second representative latter disconnected the call. 

I would request CFPB to hold the financial institutions to be responsible for not being transparent in the student loan arena. As such we have burgeoning student loans across the country. To top it financial institutions are not being transparent in their code. Enforcement of such rules and regulations will make student loan more transparent. 

Appreciate it.

302,"I have been trying to manage my loans through public service loan forgiveness ( PSLF ). I was transferred to MOHELA after consolidating my loans under the limited waiver. I submitted all paperwork on time and have since been waiting for my counts to be updated. 

With the waiver rules, I should be nearing or past the 120 required payments. However, I have been struggling with the "" employment certification forms '' ( ecf ) required to update my payment counts. The first form I submitted ( on time ) took the full 90 business days to process only to marked "" duplicate '' when it was not a duplicate form - It had new certified dates. I tried to contact MOHELA about this, but each time I was on hold so long that the call timed out and automatically disconnected me.

Now that I have literally only XXXX payments for them to verify, Mohela claims that it will take them well into the summer to verify these payments. I find this completely unacceptable, especially as Ive been diligently verifying these payments over the past XXXX years, being told each year that doing so would help my loan servicer process everything faster at the end. 

Whats worse, because of the XXXX law, I have to stay employed at a qualifying organization not just while making the XXXX payments, but also until those payments are reviewed and forgiven. I am therefore completely at XXXX whim until they decide to review and process these XXXX simple payments, which as they claim could take well into the end of summer.

For example, for each biweekly payment of {$200.00} where the principal balance was $ XXXX, the ending principal would still be $ XXXX.

318,"I am writing with a concern about a lack of transparency in the transition of my student loan from once servicer to another. 

I am a nurse practitioner working at a rural health family medicine clinic in XXXX XXXX, NM. Also, I am very fortunate to have qualified for a student loan repayment program through the Department of Health and Human Services. I have continued to make regular payments on my student loan during the student loan payment pause due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Previously my student loan had been serviced through XXXX XXXX. Two weeks ago this was transitioned to Mohela. On transition of my loan service agency I noticed the balance increased by >10 %. I was not able to obtain any concrete information as to the source of this increase in amount owed from Mohela representative ( XXXX # XXXX ), and when I sought information about this from previous servicer XXXX XXXX, I was told information will take a special request and be provided in 3-5 days via email. 

Via the XXXX XXXX website and according to the representative ( see attached chat log ), no payment history last 12 months, no balance information, including any information on accrued unpaid interest or total balance at the time of transfer to new loan servicer, are available except by special request due to the transition of my loan to a new servicer. Records are kept, but they are not readily accessible. 

I am concerned the lack of transparency and accountability in this transition leaves ample opportunity for fees and adjustments to be made that do not reflect actual balances. Im concerned the staff of either service agency have not been able to tell me why this adjustment was made. The Mohela representative ( XXXX # XXXX ) speculated it may reflect unpaid interest from prior to XX/XX/2020. However, no unpaid interest or other fees/charges were listed during the student loan payment pause on regular review of my account and balance via the XXXX XXXX website, and I am not able to confirm whether any unpaid interest was due via the chat with XXXX representative. Please note I have been working diligently and proactively to pay down my student loan balance even during the payment pause, and I absolutely would have directed my regular payments toward any unpaid interest in an effort to avoid future capitalization. 

In every other area of financial life balances and fees are clearly visible to promote accuracy and accountability of all involved parties. If unpaid interest was present, it was not visible to me. I encourage this type of information to be readily visible and accessible, with records mandated to be maintained and readily available online to borrowers via any student loan servicing agency in an effort to promote ethical treatment of people serviced by these agencies. Otherwise unethical reporting of balances/fees and adjustments may be the norm, and victimization of student borrowers may be usual practice. In addition this directly diverts and wastes the funding from the Department of Health and Human Services program I am so fortunate to participate in.

I appreciate your attention and any assistance or thoughts on this matter, and am available to answer any questions about my specific situation. I have requested the payment history, any unpaid interest, and amount of transfer from XXXX XXXX, but unfortunately this is pending. In the meantime my balance is simply higher without any explanation. 

Thank you."

320,I was misled into believing I had an offer. They performed multiple hard credit inquiries for the same product. Each time they had a question that they had to stop they would make a new inquiry on my report for the same loan. Then they withdrew the offer.
321,"My student loan balance PRIOR to receiving any refunds was {$8600.00}. I then received a letter from Mohela stating I received a total of {$18000.00} in refunds, & now my current student loan balance says I owe {$30000.00}. This is an incorrect balance. {$8700.00} plus {$18000.00} = XXXX. NOT {$30000.00}! I have tried to fix the issue via phone with Mohela few times without success. I spoke with supervisor XXXX, who said she sees the discrepancy in the balance & would reach out to another dept & call me when she hears back with corrected info. She called me the next week without any new information & said she still sees the discrepancy but will have to send to accounting to fix. My credit score has been negatively impacted by this discrepancy in my total loan balance. I haven't heard anything else regarding Mohela correcting the error. My balance is INCORRECT"
322,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed Complaint # XXXX regarding an issue with refunding student loans paid during the COVID-19 forbearance period. I filed the complaint against my prior servicer, XXXX XXXX, who responded that they were not responsible for my refund and the case was closed on XX/XX/XXXX, seemingly without anyone from the CFPB reading my complaint or the response. 

Request was made on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX to refund all student loans paid during COVID-19 forbearance period ( XXXX XXXX ). Call reference number was # XXXX. I was advised on a call two months later that I would not be able to get my student loans refunded because I paid select loan sequences in full, which I later learned was a false statement. In XX/XX/XXXX I learn that my loans are being transferred to Mohela and received an email on XX/XX/XXXX that the transfer process had began. On XX/XX/XXXX, I saw that my account had now reflected my current balance and contacted Mohela to initiate the refund process. I was told it would take 60 days. I called several times over the course of 60 days for updates, and never received any update. After 60 days, I called Mohela and was advised that the wait would now be 90 days following the influx of forgiveness applications from late XXXX following the President 's executive order. Called after 90 days from original request ( late XX/XX/XXXX ) and told loans were still in process. Was just advised today by a supervisor after being on hold for two hours and forty-five minutes that Mohela could not initiate the refund request because the loans were paid off through XXXX, not Mohela. This was the first time I received this information despite calling well over twenty times since original request was made on XX/XX/XXXX. I was directed to call XXXX. I contacted XXXX three times today, XX/XX/XXXX, and each time I call, I receive an automated response that my loans were transferred to Mohela, and I can press zero for further guidance. All three times the call was dropped. I filed the complaint with CFPB # XXXX and XXXX responded that this was Mohela 's XXXX, but Mohela claims the loans were paid off while they were serviced with XXXX, so Mohela isn't responsible. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed complaint # XXXX against Mohela upon learning that Mohela was indeed responsible for initiating the refund request as my new servicer. On XX/XX/XXXX, Mohela responded to the CFPB complaint advising that my refund request had been processed as of XX/XX/XXXX. IT IS NOW XX/XX/XXXX, AND I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE MY COVID-19 REFUND.

Upon investigation from the Department of Education OMBUDSMAN, I learned today that the Department of Treasury has been ready to issue payment for 60 days but has yet to receive information requested from Mohela. That is completely unacceptable and Mohela must be held accountable for its gross failure in handling this matter for the past 9 months."

I made an {$550.00} payment and they added on {$500.00} to my balance. I called and they promised Me that the balance would go down after making more payments.

Move the decimal over one is 10 %. I learned this in 5tXXXX grade in my head. So what first mark is saying is I am being billed over 10 %? 

Also, this loan is half the original loan meaning you can't ask every month to be the same along with claiming I owe you XXXX a day. This was XXXX a day when I started loan. The loan is 2/3 paid off and it should emulate what is owed, However this loan should not be a loan except for a federal loan."
330,"I have previously contacted American First Finance about this issue, and they mailed me some letters. After I filed an original complaint with the CFPB a representative from American First Finance LLC called me and informed me that it was fully aware of fraudulent activity involving the online merchant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that it would no longer process applications for credit in my name from XXXX XXXX XXXX and/or request credit reports from the major or sub-prime credit reporting bureaus. But just two weeks after receiving that promise by phone call American First Finance submitted another request for a consumer credit report on behalf of an Identity Thief applying at XXXX XXXX XXXX again! And this time, in spite of my having a credit report freeze in place at XXXX, XXXX released a credit report to American First Finance. And by a letter dated XX/XX/2023, American First Finance reported to me it took that action again regarding Account XXXX. The CFPB must implement some enforcement actions against American First Finance and implement and/or enforce rules concerning the Major and Sub-Prime Credit Reporting Bureaus . Such as requiring major credit bureaus to inform their sub-prime credit bureaus they own or are affiliated with that the consumer has established a freeze with them and they must honor it too. To enhance the rule, before releasing a consumer credit report to any entity ( except court ordered releases ) a sub-prime credit reporting bureau shall ask its Major credit reporting bureau if the consumer has a freeze in place. If they are told "" yes a freeze is in place '' then it shall not release a credit report and shall inform the finance company or requestor that a freeze is in place and they must inform their customer that he or she must unfreeze their report."
331,"I am currently serving in the Virginia XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked over the phone if I was eligible to receive a title loan, in which I was told yes to come into the office to complete the process. I received the title loan on XX/XX/2022 in the amount of {$2900.00} and payment was wired to my debit card/bank account. 
Upon arrival at the Title Max office located in XXXX TN, I was told that the employee needed to assess and take pictures of my vehicle. I do have a XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  license plate tag and other identifying logos that indicated that I was in fact a service member. 
At no time in the loan process was I asked if I was a military service member. It was the day before XXXX and right before the office closed and the employee was eager to make the loan and close the deal. I was not aware that it was illegal for me to even have the availability to obtain such a loan under the XXXX fair lending Act. 
All paperwork for the loan was done on a computer tablet screen that I did not see, and my signature was super imposed on multiple pages and documents after signing on a little pad one time my initials. I would have never pursued the loan if I was made aware that I was ineligible or that it was illegal for service members to be given such a loan due to the outrageous interest rates. I have made payments since XX/XX/2022 and I am now further away from paying this loan off then the day that the loan was issued. The company was not forthcoming and did not due their due diligence to see if I was eligible for such a loan. They issued the loan without proper clearance and questioning and I should have never been able to obtain such a loan as it is against the military lending act, and I would never jeopardize my family or career in such a manner had I been given the information that I was entitled too. At the time of the loan when I asked for a print out of the paper work I was told that they had printer issues and that everything would be available through their app after the loan was issued, which was also a red flag that at the time I missed.I am hoping to get this loan resolved and settled in a manner in which I can receive my title back. As the company falsified documentation without my consent and without asking me if I was in fact a XXXX XXXX XXXX  which they did not! Thank you for your time and help in resolving this matter, I truly appreciate your willingness to understand the circumstance that I have unfortunately found myself in.

332,I took this loan just before starting XXXX XXXX  at XXXX XXXX XXXX which began on the XXXX of XXXX. By XX/XX/XXXX I realized this was not for me and dropped out. I knew I would owe some money so I contacted the school to find out how much. They contacted me back and let me know I owed XXXX. I contacted the lender to work something out and we did. I received a payoff letter for the amount of XXXX on XX/XX/2023 that needed to be paid by XX/XX/XXXX. The next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) a new account was opened. I was alerted through an email. I immediately called TFC ( the lender ) and was told that XXXX renegotiated the loan for more money XXXX. Is this ethical or even legal?
333,I borrowed {$2200.00} and theyre trying to charge me % XXXX just in interest alone skyrocketing the amount I owe to XXXX. I tried calling them to discuss paying off my loan in full with minimum interest but they didnt give a option or even a 3 month repayment plan at all.
334,Recently I had requested and received a refund for payments made during the payment pause. I also had an income driven repayment plan on the remaining loan and my account was in forbearance pending my borrowers defense application. The refunded loans were cast back into repayment mode and show a past due balance. Confirmed by Federal Student Aid customer service they should have been put into forbearance pending me borrowers defense application. I tried working it out with AidVantage. Instead they put it in Covid forbearance and because of the second representative doing so the third one said she was unable to correct the mistake and I still have a past due balance. Meanwhile the Federal Student Aid office said all of my loans through XXXX  were covered by the Borrowers Defense application not just the remaining loan my Borrowers Defense application was approved and all payments made will be returned to me. Im concerned with negative credit reporting which AidVantage said would happen bc they failed to put my account in Forbearance as they were supposed to.
335,The loan was for XXXX. They are charging XXXX XXXX  interest and debit my checking account {$320.00} every XXXX weeks until XX/XX/2023. I was under the impression this was XXXX  a month and didnt know the interest was so high! This is definitely predatory lending.
336,In XX/XX/2018 or XX/XX/2018 I enrolled online classes thru XXXX XXXX. I was looking in my student portal and I noticed that there was amounts of money coming from me to the school. Then I see where their refunded to the school. And apparently I owe the school {$27000.00} around there.

I have been either deferred or forbearance status for XXXX years with no knowledge from the stdt loan center that i could have this work counted towards my balance which has since ballooned from XXXX to XXXX.

On the Mohela website under form status it indicates it has been processed and to expect a notice within 7-10 days.

I have spent hours on the phone with customer service to try to get additional information or an understanding of why my count has not been updated to reflect 120 qualifying payments or why my loans have been forgiven at this time. It is literally paperwork for one month! My employment has been the same for the past 2.5 years. I work for XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

When I am able to speak to someone at Mohela, they do not provide any specific information about my account. They repeat information to me from a script and keep repeating that there is unprecedented interest in public service loan forgiveness.

I have just noticed that most all of my payments since XX/XX/XXXX are going to interest only. During this time period I have sent them {$3000.00} and only {$740.00} has gone to principle.

This is not the case according to StudentAid.gov where I was specifically told to NOT send Mohela the form since StudentAid.gov will forward it to the server ( Mohela ). The form was sent on XX/XX/XXXX to Mohela and received on XX/XX/XXXX and has not been processed. This should have been a streamlined process.

Also, I gave this company checks that it has cashed but not put towards the balance. This is fraud since you are taking money that is not yours and asking for even more money.

I was told it would be reviewed within 90 days and my counts updated. I was moved to Mohela in XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted an updated employment verification form from my current employer XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. After not hearing anything about my initial employment verification form I submitted to XXXX, I resubmitted the XXXX health employment verification form on XX/XX/XXXX. Because the TEPSLF program had a deadline of XX/XX/XXXX, I resubmitted bother the XXXX XXXX and an updated XXXX XXXX form to Mohela on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

I confirmed with studentloan.gov that XXXX XXXX did qualify before I ever submitted the form form my previous employer to fill out. The representative double checked and agreed XXXX XXXX was a qualifying employer.

I checked my form status in XXXX XXXX and it says it was canceled, again. I called Mohela again. Let them know I have had multiple problems with this employer verification form. I submitted the original form to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and The information was never transferred over to Mohela as promised. I submitted it directly to Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX and that form was cancelled in error as a duplicate form because the original form was never processed. The form I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX was canceled in error because Mohela erroneously determined the employer didnt qualify. And the most recent expedited review was also cancelled. The XXXX agent agreed that there have been several issues. She saw they had previously thought the employer didnt qualify but upon review it did qualify. She spoke with a supervisor who agreed to do an expedited review and stated I would have an updated count of my payments within 14 days. It has now been 3 weeks and the expedited review has never occurred. They didnt resubmit my employment verification and keep sending me in an endless loop of waiting, calling, and erroneous cancellations.

The agent spoke to my client as if this wasn't there first time on the phone, which caught my client completely off-guard, at which he started to assume the call was a prank/joke. As per my client, the agent went as far to say that, "" we spoke earlier this month, you are the cosigner on the loan ''. Around this point in the conversation, my client ended the phone call, as he came to realize the call wasn't a joke and much more serious than he originally thought. 

As soon there call was over my client called me, asking "" Who's Sallie Mae and how am I a cosigner on your loan? '' I was at a loss for words. I had just spoke with them two weeks ago. So, I immediately hung up the phone to call Sallie Mae to figure out how they got the number and why they chose to call them.

I submitted a second complaint so that I could receive answers to the questions that Mohela chose not to address in their first response. However, that request was not completed. As mentioned in my first complaint, I have called Mohela ( calls are recorded as necessary ) and I received multiple different answers from multiple people. I would like a written response on why interest was added to my account, despite having 0 % interest right now. I have paid all my bills on time before the student loan pause and there was no interest accruing during that time. As mentioned in my original complaint, one person from Mohela ( via documented phone call ) has claimed this is interest that I accrued during the pandemic, another has said Mohela is charging me for requesting the refund, and a third said they don't even know. I would like a clear, written response to this request. Im not sure why my second request to clarify this issue was denied and not processed.

350,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a complaint regarding the communication I received from my loan servicer, which has caused me great concern and frustration. I recently received an email that detailed the terms and conditions of the payment modification program for my loan, and I am troubled by the implications it contains. 

I have also attempted to work with my loan servicer to lower my payments due to my current unemployment status, but my requests have been denied. I believe that this refusal to work with me is unfair and puts me at risk of defaulting on my loans. 

Specifically, the email stated that the use of a payment modification program, with the exception of Extended Borrower Repayment, may result in disqualification from certain borrower benefits, including private loan cosigner release, that require on-time payments to be made. I find this to be deeply concerning as it seems to suggest that I will lose important benefits if I take advantage of the payment modification program.

Additionally, the email indicated that if my enrollment in the program is denied or terminated, the payments I authorize will still be withdrawn and applied to my loans, but they may not be enough to cover my full monthly payment amount, which could result in delinquency. This feels like an unfair and unnecessary risk to take.

Overall, I feel that the communication I received was unclear and potentially misleading. I am concerned that I may not fully understand the terms and conditions of the payment modification program and that I may inadvertently lose important borrower benefits or become delinquent on my loans as a result of participating in the program.

Therefore, I urge you to investigate this matter and ensure that my loan servicer is providing clear and accurate information to borrowers about their options and the potential consequences of those options. Additionally, I urge you to investigate why my request to lower my payments has been denied and to take appropriate action to ensure that my loan servicer is treating borrowers fairly and in accordance with federal laws and regulations. Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
