2,"On XX/XX/2023, I entered a Bank of America Branch office to deposit my check. I asked the teller that approved and processed my deposit If the check could be manually verified before deposit so there would be no issues with holds as I am already adhering to the five business day policy that Bank of America requires ; she agreed and verified validity and funds of the check, processed transaction and provided me the receipt attached with the dates that funds would be available. The next day I called the bank of Americas customer service number because upon checking my account, I noticed that the check balance was no longer on hold, but the funds were reversed, so it looked as if I had never deposited the check. After waiting and speaking to 3 different managers, they updated the account to show a pending debit of funds instead of a reversal. They informed me that the check had been placed with an extra hold for an unspecified amount of time, even though the funds had been verified. The collection had begun because the issuing bank "" could try and collect it back '' I explained this was a settlement check from another significant bank. Even after being verified, I needed clarification on why this would be an issue and have yet to receive one. I decided to wait until XX/XX/2023, to verify if my partial release of funds was available, and it was not ; on XX/XX/2023, I called Bank of America and spoke to three managers via the Nevada office. They stated I only needed their first names as they are the only ones that work there. The call started with XXXX, who said that there would no longer be a partial release of funds due to the extended hold of the check ; she also verified at my request that the check had been verified and collected, but because this amount had not been deposited in my account before they would need additional time to ensure the check validity. I informed XXXX this was not the first time I had received a large check and that this was discriminatory behavior, and she insisted that it was not ; I then asked why none of this information was provided to me in writing and why I had to call to find out the updates on what was happening with my funds. She stated because these decisions were made at night and there wasn't time to inform me. I noted to her that my receipt from the teller with the release dates and funds availability was the only documentation I had been provided, and by that, they were in breach of their agreement with me at this time for this deposit. She told me she could only offer me a line of credit with them. She asked precisely why I needed the funds immediately ; I informed her I had children to feed, and she suggested I ask a friend for money. I was highly offended and asked to speak to her Manager, XXXX, and for another XXXX minutes, I talked to XXXX, who insisted on the two same options. Get a credit line or borrow money from a friend. After this frustrating and humiliating conversation, I asked to speak to XXXX 's manager and was transferred to XXXX, who stated she would review the account and give me a callback. I received a callback from XXXX at XXXX pm that same day. She proceeded to explain they were not going to release any funds to me and did not provide a reason but offered to give me a {$500.00} counter credit that I would need to go to the atm and pull out immediately before it wasn't available again so that I could use to funds for food for my children. I asked her who came up with that amount and why I was being offered a credit when I had a receipt showing I should have funds available. XXXX explained that was the best she could do, I stated that this was mishandled entirely and I would be submitting a complaint against all 3 of them, and XXXX explained that if I proceeded with a complaint, I would forfeit the XXXX credit. I agreed to forfeit the credit as I should have been given my funds since they breached the agreement with the receipt they provided. I also believe it is unfair to be forced into another consumer product from them ( a line of credit ) to have access to my funds. It is XX/XX/2023, when my total funds should be available, and my account balance is still negative.",Checking or savings account
3,"Folks, I am in XXXX XXXX. I was living and working in the US quite a while ago and had some monies in Bank of America. I was always able to log in via internet and see my account and check the balance. In XX/XX/2022 the debit card issued to me expired and I duly requested another card to be sent to me. I had always made sure that my contact details were updated. No new card was sent out and no contact was made. The bank 's 2 factor authentication made it impossible for me to access my account from XXXX simply because I did not have a US  mobile and BofA could not accept international mobile numbers. I was told by BofA that I needed a XXXX  USB cryptographic key to be able to access my account and to be able to make wire transfers. I was forced against my will to actually purchase a USB key ( for XXXX ) so that I can regain access to internet banking. Once I had access, I tried making a wire transfer through internet banking with the assistance of BofA staff.

I find this very unacceptable and frustrating b/c I suspect XXXX messed up ( either delivered to wrong address & person, or driver kept the order ) but refuses to take blame, but more importantly Best Buy retailer and Credit Card refuses to support a long-time customer and makes me feel like I am not worth the time and effort to resolve the matter promptly.",Credit card or prepaid card

It's XXXX, and I still have not received a check. I finally reached out to my XXXX who contacted the Department of Treasury for me to check on the status. The response to their office was that Treasury had not received the request ( language copied from email ) : When a payment does not appear in XXXX, it means payment instructions have not yet been transmitted to XXXX. The forbearance payment promised by Mohela is still with Mohela or whatever agency would transmit the payment instructions to XXXX. You will need to redirect this inquiry to determine when payment instructions will be transmitted to XXXX. 

I can not get an answer from Mohela has to how long it takes Treasury to receive information to issue a check but 2 months seems excessive. It appears that the problem is on Mohela 's end, not on Treasury 's.",Mortgage

15,"On XX/XX/XXXX I applied for a HELOC with United Wholesale Mortgage in the amount of {$110000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I closed on that HELOC and provided instructions that I wanted an initial advance in the amount of {$60000.00}. 

{$60000.00} was deposited into my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I received my first statement, dated XX/XX/XXXX, from UWM which states the outstanding principal balance of my HELOC is {$110000.00}. Puzzled, I reached out to UWM and asked them why my statement suggests that I had accessed/used the entire balance of my HELOC. The customer service agent I spoke with was unable to locate my closing documents and suggested that the remaining balance of the HELOC was likely used to pay off other creditors. This did not happen. I did not ask for my other debts to be paid off they have not been paid off. And I did not/have not taken any additional draws on the HELOC. I was informed I can submit a qualified written request challenging the accuracy of the outstanding principal balance. 

In the closing documents I was provided a copy of, the settlement statement shows the following : Loan amount = {$110000.00} Total of Origination Costs = ( {$5300.00} ) Due to Borrower = ( {$60000.00} ) HELOC Balance = {$47000.00} Id like UWM to provide me with a register of activity associated with my HELOC so I can understand where the remaining {$47000.00} was allocated. If there is other disbursements from my account these were either incorrectly applied to my account or they are fraudulent transactions. 

My current loan payment, due XX/XX/XXXX, is {$860.00}. This was calculated using interest applied to the incorrect and overstated outstanding balance of the loan. Id like this and subsequent payments to be corrected to accurately reflect my outstanding principal balance of {$60000.00}.",Mortgage

42,"Subject : Cease and Desist Communication, Notice of Identity Theft, and Request for Debt Validation Dear Sir/Madam, My name is XXXX  XXXX XXXX a federally protected consumer. I'm filing this complaint to bring to your attention a matter of utmost concern regarding the alleged debt you claim I owe. This communication serves as a formal complaint, notice of identity theft, and a request for debt validation. 

First and foremost, I want to make it explicitly clear that I have never given Amsher Collection Services any permission to use or disclose any of my identifying information. It has come to my attention that you have been using my personal information, without my consent, to contact me about an alleged debt. This unauthorized use of my identifying information constitutes a severe violation of my privacy rights and is a clear case of identity theft. 

As a consumer protected by federal law, I am aware that the assignment of a defaulted note is illegal, as stated in Article 9. This implies that any purported assignment of the alleged debt to your agency is invalid and void. Consequently, both the assignee ( Amsher Collection Services ) and the assigned ( original creditor ) are liable for violations under 15 U.S. Code 1692e ( 12 ). 

In light of the above, I demand that you immediately cease and desist all communications with me regarding this alleged debt. Furthermore, I request that you provide me with the following information : 1. Proof of your authorization to contact me regarding this alleged debt.

2. Documentation verifying the existence and validity of the alleged debt.

3. Documentation showing that the original creditor lawfully assigned the debt to Amsher Collection Services. 

If you are unable to provide sufficient proof that I owe this alleged debt, I demand that you remove all references to this debt from your records and cease any further attempts to collect it. Failure to comply with this request will leave me no choice but to pursue legal action seeking {$1000.00} per violation, as provided by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

I expect a prompt response to this letter within 4 business days from your receipt. Your cooperation in resolving this matter amicably and without further delay will be greatly appreciated. Please send all correspondences regarding this issue to the address listed above. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

48,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX I noticed fraudulent charges on my husband, XXXX XXXX, debit card that dated back approximately 2 weeks or less. On XX/XX/XXXX, {$370.00} was fraudulently charged to my husbands debit card, from various out of state venues, the bulk being XXXX XXXX in Tennessee. My husband and I have never been to Tennessee and haven't even been to the movies in a few years.I called Chase immediately and reported the charges. While speaking with the agent she entered all of the charges and then asked if I was sure that was all. I said maybe I should look back further and she encouraged me to do so. I found a few minor charges from a company that I did not recognize of less than {$8.00} each that were from XXXX and the rep said she would add those even though I said at the time that I wasnt even sure about them. I have never filed a claim for fraudulent charges and thought that if they were real charges they would just be ignored. They were such a minor amount that I had thought they were a minor purchase my husband had made and there was no fraudulent activity anytime soon after that that would have led me to investigate further. 

The money was credited back to my account but a few days later they were all debited again. Not only was the total of {$370.00} charged again, but additional charges of {$110.00} - again, mostly from XXXX XXXX in Tennessee were added as well. These had posted a few days AFTER I had reported my husbands card as compromised. I immediately called Chase and was told that because those 2 charges of less than {$8.00} were included, that ALL the charges were reinstated due to the fact those 2 minor charges were over 60 days old. I asked if I could just refile the current charges and I was told no. In addition, I was told that the charges that posted a few days AFTER I reported the fraud were my responsibility as well. I explained the circumstances that I have previously explained in this letter but was told it is policy. I worked my way up the chain, and was told time and again that it was policy and it sounded as though the agents were reading from a script as they said exactly the same lines over and over. I went to my local branch and they were very nice, and also seemed surprised at the circumstances but after calling the main claims department on my behalf were again told it was policy. 

I then filed a claim with the XXXX, and received a call from a Chase employee who was trying to help me resolve this issue. Although she was very nice and I believe she was genuinely trying to help, I was still told that the claims department said this was once again, their policy and Chase would not reconsider my case. I shared with her that this was my husbands debit card and that he was on XXXX and suffering from a currently incurable form of XXXX and neither of us might be as on top of minor charges as a result of the ongoing stress that this entails. She advised that I call the claims department again and let them know because there are exceptions for medical issues. I called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke to a few different people explaining my husbands medical condition as I hadnt realized that there might be an exception. They reopened the case after I provided medical documentation regarding his condition but a representative subsequently left a voicemail saying, .. just because he is ill doesnt mean that we will make an exception. 

I sent another letter on XX/XX/XXXX, letting them know that the early minor charges I had though MIGHT be false turned out to be legitimate and I thought they would have investigated and found this to be the case as well, but I heard nothing back from them. This alone delegitimizes their excuse for not reimbursing me, not to mention all the other circumstances involved in this case, but again, no response. 

I will be glad to forward all correspondence and voicemails upon request. It is my belief that Chase has engaged in unfair practices for a number of reasons that have been described in this letter and I am hopeful that the Consumer Finance Protection Board can help me to receive fair treatment as well as helping to prevent this type of thing from happening to others in the future.

I understand this can be negotiated and I'd feel much better if this fee was not here or it were a lower rate. The payment keeps going up and up and up.

When I asked XXXX about the additional XXXX she said this was a glitch in their system. I asked her why if she knew about the glitch, why it was not fixed and she could not answer. She seemed puzzled with my question. At this point I felt that I am deliberately being confused by this Representative. It feels like a bait and switch scheme when she talks about the numbers. I am now extremely concerned because I was expecting to close on the home on XX/XX/2023 and with that in mind I paid down payments on movers and made many arrangements to move. All of this insecurity has me very nervous and can cause me to lose a lot of money as I am purchasing this new home to accommodate my XXXX mom that lives with me and as I explained to the loan officer originally I need this home as it is handicap accessible and it will help me assist my moms deeds.

73,"On XX/XX/2023, I filed CFPB complaint # XXXX, in which I alleged retaliation against me by Capital One for my raising concerns and allegations of unfair, deceptive and abusive practices related to graduating my secured Platinum to an unsecured credit card. I also filed this same complaint with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on XX/XX/XXXX. In this complaint, I also expressed concerns and made allegations of abuse and retaliation against me by their agents, XXXX ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ) and XXXX. ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from XXXX, Principal Complaints Coordinator at Capital One ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ), who called me at XXXX XXXX. PST on a recorded line, when I was living in XXXX -- and also the address listed on my account -- and on Pacific Standard Time. I have attached the XXXX call logs from my phone number, showing that XXXX XXXX XXXX to me at XXXX XXXX  was illegally made outside the hours at which a financial institution may not call me before XXXX XXXX. local time to the address on the account. As noted, and as was said on the recorded call, XXXX violated the law and called me at XXXX XXXX. local time from an XXXX area code. I informed XXXX of this violation on the call. On this call with XXXX, we discussed the behavior from agents XXXX ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ) and XXXX. ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ), and I alleged retaliation by Capital One for restricting my accounts on XX/XX/XXXX, after only a week prior to this, I had filed a complaints alleging unfair, deceptive, abusive and unlawful practices with my Capital One Platinum secured credit card. I also expressed concerns that XXXX had told lies on my call with her and she made a threat of retaliation to re-restrict my accounts after I became frustrated and dissatisfied with her behavior. XXXX then read to me the transcripts of the calls with XXXX and XXXX, and he agreed that the call from XXXX could have been handled better. Regarding the call with XXXX, he agreed that she did, in fact, lie on that call -- she said I called her XXXX XXXX ' but as XXXX read the call transcript to me, he said on multiple occasions that I did not say that at all. Instead, as XXXX read back to me, I asked of myself : "" How XXXX do you think I am? '' XXXX agreed to forward both of these calls, along with his findings and the call transcripts, to the next level above him : Capital One 's XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX stated that he believed that particularly my call with XXXX warranted an internal review for the way I was treated. I asked XXXX, still on the recorded line, if I had done anything abusive or anything that warranted Capital One closing my accounts for my conduct, and he assured me -- on the recorded call -- that no, I was not abusive toward any of the agents. Also on this recorded call, XXXX told me that Capital One policy is that if a customer is abusive or uses foul language, company policy is to send a warning letter to the customer prior to any credit revocation or fore-closing of accounts. I have received no such thing. On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I learned, by way of looking at XXXX XXXX that my Capital One accounts had been closed. Capital One intentionally, knowingly and falsely reported that all three credit card accounts were closed on XX/XX/2023. This date of closure is knowingly, intentionally and deliberately false and inaccurate ; Capital One, again, reported this false data in retaliation for my continued, legitimate complaints against them, their business practices and their agents ' conduct. I have attached a screen shot of the information showing the accounts were falsely and inaccurately reported as closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I have also included the most recent credit card statement for my XXXX XXXX account ending in XXXX, which very clearly shows that charges were made on, and posted to, the account on and after XX/XX/XXXX, when Capital One alleges the accounts were closed. Also on XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to a Capital One representative, a Fraud and Disputes Supervisor named XXXX ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ), who refused to verbally tell me why my accounts were closed ; he told me it was against company policy to tell me that information and that I had to wait for a letter in the main. Again, I expressed to XXXX my assertion that Capital One was retaliating against me. XXXX never once acknowledged this or took action when he was told, many times on the call, that I believe Capital One is engaging in business practices that violate the law and my rights as a consumer. I then called back and spoke to XXXX ( Capital One employee ID # XXXX ) a supervisor in the Escalations Department. XXXX verbally shared with me that all my Capital One credit card accounts were closed due to my abusive behavior on a call that took place on XX/XX/XXXX. I advised XXXX that the only call I had to or from Capital One that day was from XXXX, the Principal Complaints Coordinator who is mentioned in this complaint. I asked XXXX if it was possible that there was a mix-up between XXXX filing a complaint on my behalf for the threatening and abusive call I had with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX agreed to look into it and placed me on hold. When she returned to the call, she was unable to tell me the exact details of the allegedly abusive call that Capital One claims occurred that triggered the force-closing of all my accounts When I pressed XXXX for more detail, again alleging that Capital One is engaging in illegal business practices and retaliation, she refused to answer any more of my questions and began threatening to disconnect the call. When I told XXXX I had more questions, she refused to address them and once again, on a recorded line, threatened to disconnect the call -- and she did for no valid reason. I have a mountain of evidence to substantiate my claims, concerns, assertions and allegations that Capital One has abused me, treated me unfairly, deliberately stated lies on recorded phone calls, broken their company policies -- particularly the policy that XXXX quoted to me on receiving warning letters prior to force-closing accounts if Capital One alleges abusive behavior by a customer, recorded threats of retaliation by XXXX, falsifying data that has already been reported to the credit bureaus, and retaliating against me by closing all my accounts because I blew the whistle and spoke up about the illegal, threatening, retaliatory actions and behavior exhibited by Capital One and its employees. I am fully prepared to take this case before a court of law if Capital One does not wish to resolve this amicably and with a mutually agreeable resolution -- and the evidence I have amassed more than substantiates my claims. Capital One has also caused harm to my credit score and credit file, and I have suffered credit and financial losses as a direct result of Capital One force-closing my accounts. I am also concerned and worried that Capital One has collected my sensitive, private and confidential information, including bank statements with full account numbers, when I was asked to provide them all this info and data on XX/XX/XXXX. It's worth noting that any time I file any type of complaint against Capital One -- whether internally or with regulatory bodies -- my accounts immediately and suspiciously become restricted and labeled as "" fraud, '' yet Capital One never once substantiates their claims of fraud. I believe that Capital One is intentionally and knowingly attempting to intimidate and silence me -- and possibly other customers -- from coming forward with legitimate complaints and allegations, by making any rectifying difficult, cumbersome and impossible. Again, I am fully willing and prepared to bring suit against Capital One in a court of law if we can not reach a mutually agreeable solution to my issues. In summary, Capital One is brazenly attempting to steamroll and bulldoze customers who they believe won't fight back, and I am not the type of person ; I will pursue this to the fullest extent of the law and seek all civil, criminal and other penalties for the financial and emotional harm Capital One has inflicted upon me.",Credit card or prepaid card

THESE SERVICES WERE NOT RECEIVED AND I HAVE FILED WITH THE CFPB AND DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. 

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME AS I CAN NOT SEEM TO PROVIDE THESE FACTS TO AN ACTUAL PERSON AND THE DISPUTE WAS SETTLED WITH ME HAVING TO PAY. 


For this transaction, the details are that on XX/XX/XXXX I submitted an order with online vendor "" XXXX ''. The initial reservation detail indicated travel from XXXX to XXXX and then back to XXXX XXXX XXXX for a work trip. A screenshot of this is attached ( see "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ). 

When I reviewed the actual travel portal the discount booking service had booked the trip from XXXX back to XXXX Arizona- which was incorrect. I immediately tried to call them. They have no phone number - only an e-mail address. I contacted this e-mail address and they only provided me with the screenshot of the incorrect booking. 

Note that I made the booking for an airline and contacted them within a few minutes ( about an hour ) from the original purchase. According to UXXXX Department of Transportation rules, this airline ( or the travel agent ) I think should have been able to immediately refund the flight or change to the correct flight. The screenshot of the incorrect booking from their system just reiterates the point that there was an error with the ticket. 

Contacting the vendor 's chat team was incredibly difficult. There were many spelling typos and they did not understand my request ( see "" XXXX Customer Service '' ). I have also tried to communicate with this vendor over e-mail. Their online spelling and communication is very difficult- there are many typos ( and no phone number ) ( see "" XXXX E-mail XXXX '' and "" XXXX e-mail 2 '' ). In these communications, they frustratingly just sent me the picture of their incorrect system and did not offer any solutions. 

This is a lesson learned. In looking at XXXX, many customers have had this issue. There are over XXXX reviews and over XXXX of them are one star due to similar issues. 

Because of this issue, I immediately booked the correct travel directly with another airline ( with the accurate booking ). 

I have also filed a detailed dispute with the US Department of Transportation who appears to have a file on this merchant for similar issues ( see "" Department of Transportation Referral '' ). 

I wanted to provide this detail to you for the above-noted case so that you may have the information necessary to hopefully proceed. 

I hope this can be resolved favorably. I have not received any merchandise or services from this vendor and, in fact, they appear to have just cancelled my reservation in their system ( see "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ).

148,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally lodge a comprehensive complaint against Ally Financial for their role in the unfair and deceptive practices during my purchase of a XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX  Misrepresentation of Loan Terms : Ally Financial processed and approved a loan for my vehicle, which I believed to have an interest rate of XXXX  % based on the initial invoice contract dated XX/XX/XXXX. However, upon receipt of my first billing statement, I found that the interest rate was substantially higher, at XXXX  %. This discrepancy has resulted in a significantly increased financial burden and inflated overall cost of the vehicle. 

2.  Inconsistent Financing Terms : The terms of the loan presented to me were inconsistent. The initial invoice contract stated the price and financing terms clearly but did not mention any stipulations related to arbitration. However, the subsequent Retail Installment Contract signed on XX/XX/XXXX, introduced an arbitration clause, significantly altering the terms to my disadvantage. This change was neither clarified nor adequately explained to me. 

3.  Undisclosed Relationships and Potential Kickbacks : I have reasons to believe that Ally Financial and XXXX XXXX XXXX may have a pre-existing business relationship, possibly involving kickbacks or incentives, which was not disclosed to me during the negotiation or finalization of my vehicle purchase. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the fairness and legitimacy of the loan terms and interest rate. 

4. Noncompliance with TILA : Ally Financial 's failure to accurately disclose the terms of my auto loan, as well as their potential noncompliance with the arbitration disclosure requirements, may constitute violations of the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). TILA mandates that lenders provide borrowers with clear, accurate, and meaningful information about the cost and terms of credit. 

These alleged malpractices by Ally Financial are not only detrimental to me but also potentially harmful to a wider consumer base. I, therefore, appeal to the CFPB to exercise its authority to investigate and rectify these injustices. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am confident that the CFPB will uphold its commitment to consumer protection and ensure fair practices in the auto financing industry.",Vehicle loan or lease

Based on my personal experience and research, it is clear that your company intentionally makes it difficult for borrowers to access their account information, apply for loan modifications or refinancing, and receive accurate and timely responses to their inquiries. 

Specifically, I was locked into a high interest variable rate loan and given false information on repayment options. I have also experienced unresponsiveness from your representatives and received conflicting or misleading information when trying to seek help. This has left me feeling frustrated and hopeless about my ability to repay my loans. 

Furthermore, I am aware of the several legal cases and investigations brought against your company, including the 2014 lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and lawsuits from several state attorneys general. These allegations of excessive fees, misleading information about loan terms and options, and failure to properly process payments are deeply troubling.

Ok, no problem. But after patiently waited for 2 months, I still have not received anything from Citibank as of XX/XX/XXXX, so I called them again and this time they told me I will not be getting a check of the remaining balanced on my closed account.

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX states that Citibank should return the remaining funds directly to me, because it`s my money in Citibank account. If Citibank suspects any fraud involved in this transfer, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX expects Citibank to contact their fraud department and provided a contact email address.

Unfortunately, I have recently discovered that Freedom Mortgage Corp has reported late payments to credit bureaus in XXXX  despite the Heroes Act being in effect during the specified period.

220,"I am writing to file a formal complaint against Freedom Mortgage Corporation ( "" Freedom Mortgage '' ), a mortgage servicing company that I currently have my home loan with for the above mentioned legal address and loan number. On XX/XX/, I submitted a letter of complaint to Freedom Mortgage via their online service portal, detailing my dissatisfaction with their service and the issues I have experienced with their escrow department. However, in a call I had with a representative named "" XXXX '' in their escalations team, I was informed that they were not handling my complaint and did not know where it was. As a result, I sent the same letter to their email on XX/XX/, and have not received any acknowledgement of receipt or response as of the date of this letter. 

In the aforementioned letter to Freedom Mortgage, I expressed my disappointment with their service and the trouble I have had with their escrow department, including an erroneous escrow surplus check I received in XX/XX/, an escrow shortage notice I received in XX/XX/, and the misapplication of my extra payments to my loan principal. Despite numerous phone calls and requests for an explanation, I have not received a satisfactory resolution to these issues, and I am deeply concerned about the handling of my escrow account. 

Furthermore, on XX/XX/, I also requested to have a copy of my loan agreement sent to me, but as of this writing, I have not received it. This lack of response and unresponsiveness is unacceptable and only adds to the growing list of issues I have had with Freedom Mortgage. 

I am seeking the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions in resolving these issues and holding Freedom Mortgage accountable for their poor service. As a borrower, I have the right to be treated fairly and with respect, and I believe that Freedom Mortgage has violated these rights by their handling of my account. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I have enclosed a copy of my original letter to Freedom Mortgage for your review, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Below is the body of the letter I submitted on the Freedom Mortgage online service portal. This letter was also emailed to a member of the Freedom Mortgage Escalation team.

To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the service I have received from Freedom Mortgage. I have been a customer of your company for several years now, and I have never experienced such frustration and inconvenience as I have with your escrow department. In XXXX of this year, I received a check for {$680.00} from your escrow department, which was supposed to be a surplus because your department had determined that my real estate taxes were only {$80.00}. However, in XXXX, I received another letter from your company informing me of an escrow shortage of {$890.00}. When I called customer service to inquire about this, I was told to mail a check for the shortage amount and mark in the memo "" for escrow account, '' which I did promptly. The check was cashed by your organization on XX/XX/. Since then, I have made two extra payments of {$1000.00}, but your company has not corrected my payment and has not applied the proper curtailments to my loan principal as expected. Instead, I am still being charged {$1000.00} as a payment. I demand that you fix my escrow account immediately. Furthermore, I was misled by your company this year, and I feel that my rights as a borrower under the Dodd Frank Act have been violated. I demand that you retroactively pay my curtailment principal for the months of XXXX and XX/XX/2023 rather than apply the curtailment for this month, since your company did not properly apply my escrow payment on XX/XX/2023. I do not believe the Freedom Mortgage Escrow and Customer Service representives are properly trained in handling my requests over the phone, as every time I call in, they try to peddle me to another department or ask that I submit an online request. I have spent countless hours on the phone with your representives trying to resolve this issue, and I am tired of the inconvenience and frustration that your company has served me. As a result, I do not wish to speak over the phone with any representatives of Freedom Mortgage. Instead, I request that you communicate your action plan to fix your mistake through my email at XXXX. I believe that this will allow for a more efficient and effective communication process and will help to resolve this matter in a timely and satisfactory manner. I understand that your company is the largest provider of VA loans, but I feel that my business has been reduced to just a number to you. I hope that you will take my concerns seriously and take the necessary steps to correct this situation promptly. 
Lastly, I want to express that if your company can not find the time, or competence, to correct your Escrow department 's errors when I make the XX/XX/2023 payment, I will have no choice but to pursue complaints with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions. As a customer, I expect to receive proper and fair treatment from my mortgage company. If your company is unable or unwilling to provide that, I will have no other recourse but to escalate my complaints to the proper regulators. 
This letter is being submitted online through the Freedom Mortgage online customer service portal on freedommortgage.com. I hereby certify that the above information is accurate and truthful to the best of my knowledge. This letter serves as a legal document and a formal notice of my dissatisfaction with the service provided by your company. I reserve all rights to pursue legal action and/or file a complaint with the appropriate regulatory agencies if this matter is not resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner.",Mortgage

Problem # 1 = insurance information was never updated on the portal! 

A bit later I found out that Planet Home Lending decided that the property was in zone A ( though FEMA map shows it in zone X ) and requested my insurance agent to find the quote for zone A and additional funds were disbursed to pay higher insurance. 
Problem # 2 = I was not informed, not a single letter, email, etc. All of this was done behind my back and my insurance agent told me that Planet Home Lending assured them that I was aware. 
Problem # 3 - FEMA shows that the property is located in zone X and the original flood insurance I had was sufficient to cover for flood insurance. 

in XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Planet Home Lending informing me that I did not have an active flood insurance and that I needed to get one, otherwise PHL would purchase an expensive one for me.

XXXX XXXX, 2023 : Complainant submitted all information for pre-approval process via the BOA online portal. This included assets, income, and demographic information requested. 

XXXX XXXX, 2023 : Was made aware that based on the information provided in the pre-approval loan application that we were not eligible for the intended program ( for XXXX and XXXX communities ) based on one of the credit scores of one of the applicants. XXXX from BOA informed us of another option, which was the XXXX XXXX XXXX program that we would qualify for based on the information provided. This program required us to take a five hour class, submit a monthly budget to a HUD counselor, and have a counseling call to discuss the feasibility of purchasing a home with that counselor. Because this was our only option, we agreed. 

XXXX XXXX, 2023 : XXXX forwarded us a list of approved providers in the XXXX area and we signed up for a HUD Class through XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. Needed to re-arrange our schedule and get pre-approved time off work because of the timing of the class. 

XX/XX/2023 : Both my significant other and I took the 5 hour class via zoom. We received certificates of completion the next day from XXXX XXXX  XXXX and were instructed to sign up for a counseling session with a HUD counselor. Before scheduling the session, we needed to submit a monthly budget and authorization forms for our credit to be pulled and discussed to during the meeting. All of which we did. 

XX/XX/2023 : Completed the counseling session with XXXX XXXX ( HUD Counselor ). During this session, XXXX did not express any concerns about my credit report or anything noted in it. We went through the XXXX open accounts. XXXX, did however, express concern for two of the items on my partners credit report. He stated that he would not be able to provide a certificate of completion for the program until we took care of both of those issues with XXXX and XXXX. 

XX/XX/2023 : As instructed, we paid off over {$20000.00} in debt from XXXX XXXX XXXX years ago and sent the proof over to XXXX. XXXX then provided us with certificates from HUD for completing the program, as instructed, so that it could be used for pre-approval in our home buying process. 

XX/XX/2023 : I submitted our certificates of completion to XXXX from BOA via email to review. 

XX/XX/2023 : XXXX informed me that between my partner and I, we made too much money to qualify for the program he originally pointed us to ( something he knew from the beginning by having access to our application ). Frustrated, I asked about other options and he stated that because of the amount of money that I take home, we could try getting pre-approved with just me. I asked to move forward with that process. 

XX/XX/2023 : XXXX informed me that the late 30-day and 60-day late payment on my account from XXXX XXXX is a deterrent for approval. I then informed him that the payment was late because I was in and out of the hospital and XXXX, so was not able to pay any of my bills. He said he would submit to a senior manager for review and an exception. He did not take any other additional information at that time ( no dates of XXXX medical bills, decreased income based on medical issues, etc. ) XX/XX/2023 : XXXX called me to inform me that the Senior Manager did not approve my request. He stated that we could send the information to the underwriter for review but it would take about XXXX - XXXX weeks. Based on the information we were given, we started the process a month before we needed an answer, and we don't have two weeks because we need to give our current landlord a 60-day notice to vacate because our lease is up XX/XX/XXXX. 

My issues are as follows : - Lack of training on the end of BOA. XXXX had our information from the beginning, and since we did not qualify for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, we never should have been pointed in that direction, and were given incorrect information. 
- There is MAJOR disconnect between HUD and BOA for a program they claim helps disenfranchised people get into homes. Our HUD counselor saw no issue with my late payment, which I spent over an hour going through the same credit report that BOA is using.

- No clear process. There is no clear process laid out for the programs available, only further disenfranchising people that are already marginalized. We spent XXXX hours, took time off work, and paid over {$2000.00} in debt, all in the name of some arbitrary process is unclear and mucky at best. 

BOA is taking advantage of people, not training their staff properly, mis-leading customers in a way that is causing future financial harm.

264,"Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a distressing situation involving a fraudulent contract that I was coerced into by XXXX XXXX XXXX and Road Auto Finance. I believe that my consumer rights have been violated, and I am seeking your assistance in resolving this matter. 

In the contract that was presented to me, I discovered several instances of false information, including incorrect names and fabricated down payment details. I want to clarify that I only provided a down payment of {$500.00} and entrusted the dealership to hold the car for me until I received my refund check. However, to my surprise, the dealership had already proceeded with the paperwork and submitted inaccurate information to Road Auto Finance, stating that I had made a down payment of {$2000.00}. Unfortunately, by that point, I felt compelled to proceed with the sale due to my vulnerable position and immediate need for transportation. 

Within the first week of acquiring the vehicle, I experienced multiple issues and promptly notified XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, he informed me that no repairs would be undertaken until I paid an additional {$1500.00}, threatening to withhold my tags unless I complied. Consequently, XXXX XXXX XXXX held my tags and forced me to visit the DMV to retrieve them. This situation has caused undue distress and financial burden. 

Moreover, after several months had passed, I contacted Road Auto Finance to explain the discrepancies in my transaction, including the misrepresented down payment and the incorrect names on the contract. I further expressed my concerns regarding the negative impact these inconsistencies had on my credit profile. Shockingly, XXXX XXXX from the legal department dismissed my concerns, stating that I should never have signed the contract and demanded immediate payment, or else they would repossess my vehicle. It is important to note that I was only eight days late with my payment, whereas repossession typically occurs after a period of 30 days or more. 

Furthermore, I have discovered that my personal information has been shared with a non-affiliated third party called XXXX XXXX XXXX without providing me with proper written notice. This breach of confidentiality has caused me extreme emotional, financial, and psychological distress, ultimately resulting in an alarming incident where a tow truck driver arrived at my residence in an aggressive manner, necessitating police intervention. Such actions are in clear violation of U.S.C. 15 1692f ( 6 ), which prohibits non-judicial actions that lead to dispossession or disablement of property when there is no intention to take possession. 

Additionally, I want to bring your attention to the dealership 's failure to disclose that the vehicle had undergone electrical repairs and had been flooded, causing long-term issues, including the malfunctioning of the horn. 

Given the severe distress caused by Road Auto Finance and the lack of resolution thus far, I am left with no choice but to consider reaching out to the Attorney Generals of Florida and Georgia, namely XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, respectively. I am also contemplating pursuing legal action through the small claims court if a resolution can not be reached. 

I kindly request that you investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action against XXXX XXXX XXXX and Road Auto Finance for their deceptive, abusive, and unfair practices, as outlined in 15 U.S.C. 1962. Additionally, I urge you to address the violation of 15 U.S.C. 6802, which pertains to the unauthorized sharing of my personal information with third parties without proper written notice.

I think they should have to knock my interest rate down to at least 26 % that my state would allow. And also make my payments once a month instead of twice a month. They should also have to stop reporting it to my credit report because I did not agree on this loan overall they should just completely wipe the loan out because I never agreed on their terms they never showed me the terms I have a copy of their email responding to me that it had all been canceled and that I would not be charged anything I have that email,Vehicle loan or lease

278,"For background context, I recently had a serious medical/dental issue and needed to pay for a very expensive dental procedure. 

On XX/XX/2023, I called Truist to ask about a payment deferral to take care of my immediate medical expenses.

As of XXXX XXXX Monday XX/XX/2023, I hadnt received the email, so I called back. I asked if it could be sent to me while I was on the phone so that I could verify if I got it. I was told no. I said okay, to be honest, if I didnt get the first one Im not sure Ill get the second one anyway, as this is clearly an issue with their email server. I asked if there was an alternate way to get the document- via fax or postal service. I was again told no. I asked why I couldnt just receive it in the mail and was told it had to expire, which made no sense considering I was asking for a different method. The rep refused to tell me how long it would take to expire and what my next steps should be. 

I hung up and called back, getting a different rep. This one talked over me, talked down to me, and would not let me ask a question. He kept repeating something along the lines of maam are you going to work with me as a team? Just repeatedly saying that over and over and refusing to allow me to get a word in or ask my questions. He finally said he could mail it, but would I be willing to wait ten days? I asked for some clarification on the ten days - did that mean I would receive it within ten days or did that mean I had to wait ten days and then call back to resubmit my request? He refused to answer the question and kept asking his working as a team question. I dont need to work as a team for these people ; they already are a team, and their job as a team is to assist me, which they did not. 

I ended up ending the call and was so upset over the incident I began to cry. I was trying to do a very simple thing and asking basic questions, and instead of being helped I was being spoken to like a bad child. I called back a third time and got a different rep who finally agreed to mail me the agreement. 

However, later on that night I went online and realized I could file a request there. I did so, which also raised a red flag. If they had actually processed my request, why did it not say it was already pending and not allow me to submit a new one?

I called back after they'd reported my account as delinquent to see if I could just payoff the account and remove the negative reporting and the new representative stated that I received false information and that Citizen DID offer hardship options to people and that the representative I spoke to should have provided me with those options. Had I received those options, I am sure I could have prevented my account from becoming delinquent. 

Therefore, had I been given all of the information when I first called ( before I became delinquent ) I would not have had to go through the negative reporting. I was not given complete information, the first representative was lazy and unprofessional and as a result my credit report was impacted. I know all calls are recorded and the first call should be recorded, I want a supervisor or manager to listen to the first and second call so they can see how stark the differences are and I need an explanation as to why their representatives are not trained the same, and I need that negative reporting removed because I could have worked out an arrangement on the first call, BEFORE I WAS LATE, and prevented my credit score from being impacted.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"
282,"Mohela, according to the Mohela customer service rep I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX, explained that Mohela 's processing error led to a letter/notification that my employer did not complete questions 9-12 on the employer verification form that my employer submitted. She pulled up my materials and confirmed that my employer verification form was complete ( all required responses were provided along with appropriate signature ). 

The representative said that my application file ( including employer 's form and employer 's eligibility ) was complete and should cleared review. ' I was already past the 90-day period the Mohela site posted as my processing time, my application is complete ( according the representative who reviewed it with me during my call ), but the representative said that Mohela would reset my processing for another 90-day period to clear my application for approval. 

The representative did reset my application, which now shows that a new 90-day processing period has begun. Now a week later, I received a notification detailing that my payments will resume ( but I am way over the 120 payments for XXXX forgiveness ), Furthermore, the rep ( who was polite, no troubles there ) suggested that I resubmit my borrower 's page for the XXXX application, and noted that I should resign my signature on the original application page. I did as suggested ( see attached ) and now that submission is listed as resetting the 90-day processing for review. 

As the end of the federal forbearance period is coming soon, I am out of time with the uncertainty that additional Mohela reviewing errors will likely continue to reset and delay my approval. The Mohela employee reviewed all my materials while I was on the phone, and she clearly stated that all my materials were in order and that it was flagged in error and now must start the process from scratch. 

From consumer reports from CFPB, there is clearly a pattern of Mohela delays and errors that jeopardize timely and accurate review for official approval. 

If the rep I spoke with can confirm all my materials and information is in order, why am I back to square one, and why do I need to wait another 3+ months fearing that the error-prone review process will delay and disturb my official approval. 

I made more than 120 payments towards XXXX forgiveness. 
All forms ( including employer form from employer ) were submitted before the XX/XX/XXXX deadline. 
Mohela rep explained my files were complete and accurate, and that the application shouldn't have been flagged as having an error.

I am currently 3 months ahead on my payments and no matter what when I apply an extra payment it continues to apply a certain amount to the interest despite being ahead. The only way to apply additional payments to principal is to add it on to an automatic pay option. There are even fees that are being paid that I don't understand or can not tell what they are.

318,"I am writing with a concern about a lack of transparency in the transition of my student loan from once servicer to another. 

I am a nurse practitioner working at a rural health family medicine clinic in XXXX XXXX, NM. Also, I am very fortunate to have qualified for a student loan repayment program through the Department of Health and Human Services. I have continued to make regular payments on my student loan during the student loan payment pause due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Previously my student loan had been serviced through XXXX XXXX. Two weeks ago this was transitioned to Mohela. On transition of my loan service agency I noticed the balance increased by >10 %. I was not able to obtain any concrete information as to the source of this increase in amount owed from Mohela representative ( XXXX # XXXX ), and when I sought information about this from previous servicer XXXX XXXX, I was told information will take a special request and be provided in 3-5 days via email. 

Via the XXXX XXXX website and according to the representative ( see attached chat log ), no payment history last 12 months, no balance information, including any information on accrued unpaid interest or total balance at the time of transfer to new loan servicer, are available except by special request due to the transition of my loan to a new servicer. Records are kept, but they are not readily accessible. 

I am concerned the lack of transparency and accountability in this transition leaves ample opportunity for fees and adjustments to be made that do not reflect actual balances. Im concerned the staff of either service agency have not been able to tell me why this adjustment was made. The Mohela representative ( XXXX # XXXX ) speculated it may reflect unpaid interest from prior to XX/XX/2020. However, no unpaid interest or other fees/charges were listed during the student loan payment pause on regular review of my account and balance via the XXXX XXXX website, and I am not able to confirm whether any unpaid interest was due via the chat with XXXX representative. Please note I have been working diligently and proactively to pay down my student loan balance even during the payment pause, and I absolutely would have directed my regular payments toward any unpaid interest in an effort to avoid future capitalization. 

In every other area of financial life balances and fees are clearly visible to promote accuracy and accountability of all involved parties. If unpaid interest was present, it was not visible to me. I encourage this type of information to be readily visible and accessible, with records mandated to be maintained and readily available online to borrowers via any student loan servicing agency in an effort to promote ethical treatment of people serviced by these agencies. Otherwise unethical reporting of balances/fees and adjustments may be the norm, and victimization of student borrowers may be usual practice. In addition this directly diverts and wastes the funding from the Department of Health and Human Services program I am so fortunate to participate in.

I appreciate your attention and any assistance or thoughts on this matter, and am available to answer any questions about my specific situation. I have requested the payment history, any unpaid interest, and amount of transfer from XXXX XXXX, but unfortunately this is pending. In the meantime my balance is simply higher without any explanation. 

Thank you.",Mortgage

Request was made on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX to refund all student loans paid during COVID-19 forbearance period ( XXXX XXXX ). Call reference number was # XXXX. I was advised on a call two months later that I would not be able to get my student loans refunded because I paid select loan sequences in full, which I later learned was a false statement.

Called after 90 days from original request ( late XX/XX/XXXX ) and told loans were still in process. Was just advised today by a supervisor after being on hold for two hours and forty-five minutes that Mohela could not initiate the refund request because the loans were paid off through XXXX, not Mohela.

I contacted XXXX three times today, XX/XX/XXXX, and each time I call, I receive an automated response that my loans were transferred to Mohela, and I can press zero for further guidance. All three times the call was dropped. I filed the complaint with CFPB # XXXX and XXXX responded that this was Mohela 's XXXX, but Mohela claims the loans were paid off while they were serviced with XXXX, so Mohela isn't responsible. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed complaint # XXXX against Mohela upon learning that Mohela was indeed responsible for initiating the refund request as my new servicer. On XX/XX/XXXX, Mohela responded to the CFPB complaint advising that my refund request had been processed as of XX/XX/XXXX. IT IS NOW XX/XX/XXXX, AND I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE MY COVID-19 REFUND.

I am over 120 payments and qualify for forgiveness with the TEPSLF prior to ever transferring to Mohela if my forms would have been reviewed when I was with XXXX. This is causing undue stress and anxiety and wasting my time calling over and over again.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"
345,"On ( XX/XX/23 ) XXXXXXXX XXXX, My client received a call from an agent at Sallie Mae. The agent spoke to my client as if this wasn't there first time on the phone, which caught my client completely off-guard, at which he started to assume the call was a prank/joke. As per my client, the agent went as far to say that, "" we spoke earlier this month, you are the cosigner on the loan ''. Around this point in the conversation, my client ended the phone call, as he came to realize the call wasn't a joke and much more serious than he originally thought. 

As soon there call was over my client called me, asking "" Who's Sallie Mae and how am I a cosigner on your loan? '' I was at a loss for words. I had just spoke with them two weeks ago. So, I immediately hung up the phone to call Sallie Mae to figure out how they got the number and why they chose to call them. 

The first agent I spoke ( XXXX ) couldn't give me an answer as to why she called my client, nor how, saying, "" I don't know how we got the number ''. I was then transferred to her manager XXXX XXXX XXXX, who told me the same thing "" I don't know '' and then transferred to the supervisor ( XXXX XXXX, who told me it was a "" skip tracer call '' which are only permitted at "" 60 days of no communication ''. 

I am very concerned about my privacy. Thankfully it was my client who picked up the phone.",Mortgage

349,"This is my third time submitting this follow-up. Mohelas response to my first CFPB request did not answer all my questions. I submitted a second complaint so that I could receive answers to the questions that Mohela chose not to address in their first response. However, that request was not completed. As mentioned in my first complaint, I have called Mohela ( calls are recorded as necessary ) and I received multiple different answers from multiple people. I would like a written response on why interest was added to my account, despite having 0 % interest right now. I have paid all my bills on time before the student loan pause and there was no interest accruing during that time. As mentioned in my original complaint, one person from Mohela ( via documented phone call ) has claimed this is interest that I accrued during the pandemic, another has said Mohela is charging me for requesting the refund, and a third said they don't even know. I would like a clear, written response to this request. Im not sure why my second request to clarify this issue was denied and not processed. It does not even appear in my CFPB dashboard of requests anymore. This is my third request. The first complaint number is XXXX. The second complaint number is XXXX.",Mortgage
350,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a complaint regarding the communication I received from my loan servicer, which has caused me great concern and frustration. I recently received an email that detailed the terms and conditions of the payment modification program for my loan, and I am troubled by the implications it contains. 

I have also attempted to work with my loan servicer to lower my payments due to my current unemployment status, but my requests have been denied. I believe that this refusal to work with me is unfair and puts me at risk of defaulting on my loans. 

Specifically, the email stated that the use of a payment modification program, with the exception of Extended Borrower Repayment, may result in disqualification from certain borrower benefits, including private loan cosigner release, that require on-time payments to be made. I find this to be deeply concerning as it seems to suggest that I will lose important benefits if I take advantage of the payment modification program.

Additionally, the email indicated that if my enrollment in the program is denied or terminated, the payments I authorize will still be withdrawn and applied to my loans, but they may not be enough to cover my full monthly payment amount, which could result in delinquency. This feels like an unfair and unnecessary risk to take.

Overall, I feel that the communication I received was unclear and potentially misleading. I am concerned that I may not fully understand the terms and conditions of the payment modification program and that I may inadvertently lose important borrower benefits or become delinquent on my loans as a result of participating in the program.

Therefore, I urge you to investigate this matter and ensure that my loan servicer is providing clear and accurate information to borrowers about their options and the potential consequences of those options. Additionally, I urge you to investigate why my request to lower my payments has been denied and to take appropriate action to ensure that my loan servicer is treating borrowers fairly and in accordance with federal laws and regulations. Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX",Mortgage
