I started my loan process toward securing a VA loan. 
    I was waiting for a a month and a couple weeks, then I was told that the VA needed  
    to acquire my retirement points to verify my veteran status. If I knew this is what 
    my loan was on hold for, I could have contacted the VA office right away and got this cleared up. 
    For whatever reason, it took the underwriting department a long time to verify my employment status, 
    even after I uploaded a couple years of my W2 forms from both of my jobs, and they had my 
    Social Security number to further verify my employment status. My loan completion date 
    was extended, because I wasn't made aware that they were waiting for my VA status to be approved. 
    The push back for my mortgage is common for mortgage companies, but this caused my interest rate to go up. 
    Then, the securing of a closing lawyer being made aware to me and the lawyer needing three days to 
    get their end prepared for me to go to their office to sign the paperwork wasn't made aware to me. 
    My loan missed the second closing date. For whatever reason, the locked in interest rate jumped up 5/8 points. 
    After making the banker I was working with aware of this, he didn't understand why the locked in 
    interest rate jumped up either. He was nice enough to work on it and was able to get the interest 
    rate down in 1/4 of a point, so my mortgage has an interest rate that is 3/8 of a point higher 
    than my locked in interest rate in the beginning of this process. Although my interest rate is 
    higher than the locked in interest point, at the end, the mortgage is successfully finished.
