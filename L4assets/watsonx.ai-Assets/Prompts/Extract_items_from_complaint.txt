Customer complaint:
I just tried to book a flight on your incredibly slow website.  All 
the times and prices were confusing.  I liked being able to compare 
the amenities in economy with business class side by side.  But I 
never got to reserve a seat because I didn't understand the seat map.  
Next time, I'll use a travel agent!
