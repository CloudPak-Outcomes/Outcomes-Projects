Since XX/XX/2023, XXX has been calling several times a day and more than 7 times within one week. They repossessed my car and provided misleading and inaccurate information about the process. My car was repossessed when my payment was 54 days last due ; however, I was informed during a prior call that it would not occur until 60 days past due.

Text:"""I was forced to take a predatory loan that claimed to offer 90 day XXXX interest. After one late payment all the XXXX interest terms went out the window. I have since paid the debt in full and even over paid. They now refuse to refund me without reopening the account. They obviously do this to trap me into a never ending cycle of interest and fees. I have attached today 's email exchange. 
To XXXX : Refund the {$95.00}. Stop making things. difficult Stop scamming people."""

Class: Generic loan

Text:"""I contacted the bank about how my statement has two separate interests rates. One for cash advance and one on regular interest. The Interest for the cash advance will stop once the full payment on the account is made. So even if I pay back the amount I took out from the cash advance I will still be charged until I pay my whole balance. The reason they do this is because " The company is not allocated that way, so we can not separate where the money go. '' Quote From the Member of resolution team. The fact that it is the bank who sets up the fees, amounts as well as where the money goes is concerning sense this bank that is suppose to be supporting Troops or " American Soldiers. '' This seems like a way that would benefit the Bank more than the soldiers. Sense I didn't have a XXXX balance even after a year I was still being charged interest, but was paying.

Class: Student loan

Text:""""I received a bill in the mail from Chase for a credit card I did not have. Although it looked legitimate, I doubted that it was real. I looked up the phone number on the actual Chase site and called. After verifying my identity, they confirmed that the account had been opened and marked it as fraudulent. They notified me that the individual that opened it used 'my social security number ' and they are investigating it.Charges of {$5600.00} on that card that had been opened for the full bank statement duration. Chase told me to contact XXXX and supplied me with the number. I called XXXX and opted for the credit freeze option. My concern is this may be just the beginning of accounts opened in my name although the credit report I viewed showed no activity, I recognize that it and possibly others simply may not be logged yet. Chase is handling it correctly, XXXX took proper action in my opinion. I'm simply wanting to ask if there's more I should be doing to lock down my Social Security number to better protect myself."""
