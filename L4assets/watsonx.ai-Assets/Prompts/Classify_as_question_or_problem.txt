Model choice: Models that have been instruction-tuned can generally perform this task with this sample prompt. Suggestions: mt0-xxl-13b, flan-t5-xxl-11b, or flan-ul2-20b

Decoding: Greedy. The model must only return one of the class names, not be creative and make up new classes.

Stopping criteria: Specify two stop sequences: "Question" and "Problem". After the model generates either of those words, it should stop.
    With such short output, the Max tokens parameter can be set to 5.
