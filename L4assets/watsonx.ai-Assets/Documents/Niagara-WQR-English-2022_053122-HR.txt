State of the Art Purification
Niagara Bottling utilizes state of the art purification, filtration and disinfection technologies to produce safe and refreshing products for our customers to enjoy. Niagara Bottling is pleased to provide you this water quality report. 
History
It all started back in 1963 when Andrew Peykoff Sr. began to bottle high quality, low cost Niagara water in 5 gallon glass containers for home and office delivery. With his insurmountable work ethic, integrity and customer service, Niagara soon became a household name in southern California. The customer base quickly expanded and Niagara started providing single-serve private label bottled water to grocery, club and convenience stores as well as wholesale customers all the while maintaining the family owned-business values. 
Over the following decades, Niagara made significant advancements in high speed manufacturing and innovative bottle design; it’s no wonder why Niagara is now considered the largest family-owned and operated bottled water company in the United States. The company now has 41 manufacturing facilities and is continuing to grow under the President and CEO, Andy Peykoff II.
Mission Statement
Niagara’s mission is to be the premier national bottled water supplier by providing our customers unmatched quality, price, and service. We achieve this through the relentless pursuit of cutting-edge bottling technology, vertical integration and ongoing improvement of process efficiencies. Ultimately our mission can only be obtained through our most important competitive advantage, our people. The hard work, integrity and dedication of every Niagara team member will shape the future success of our company for generations to come.
Sustainability Initiatives
Light Weight Bottles & Vertical Integration 
As innovators, Niagara is always looking for ways to improve through technological advancements and processes that help reduce our impact on the environment. Our newest light weight package completely eliminates the need for a cardboard tray and the cases take up less pallet space which allows us to ship more water per order and subsequently reduce our CO2 emissions.
Since 2010 Niagara has progressively reduced the amount of plastic in our bottles, achieving an average weight reduction of 31% in the bottle and 51% in the cap. In addition to being one of the lightest water bottles in the world, our bottles and caps are recyclable. 
Through this optimization and several other intiatives, Niagara:
• Saved 789 Million Pounds of CO2 in the    last 10 years
• Reduced the energy needed to manufacture    our containers by 38.2% 
• Has the lowest ratio of packaging weight to    product of any material used for single serve    bottled water
• Optimized transportation routes reducing    our Greenhouse gas emissions by 5% from    trucking
• Completely eliminated the use of cardboard    tier sheets saving over 37 million pounds    of cardboard and  more than 227 million    pounds of CO2 in 10 years
Our goal is to continue with dematerialization and process optimization through innovative science and technology. This is all made possible by our vertically integrated process where bottles are molded into shape and filled all on the same line. Complete process control is easily maintained and constantly improved in our own facilities and according to our process capabilities.

All water bottled by Niagara comes from carefully sourced springs, wells and/or municipal water supplies. Each source is tested as it enters our facility to ensure compliance with state and federal regulations. Product is then monitored and tested through the purification and bottling process to ensure we continue to make a consistently high quality product. Screening is conducted for more than 190 chemical attributes as well as physical and flavor characteristics. This level of testing surpasses the requirements set in place by the by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

Audits
All Niagara facilities are audited on a monthly basis by the Niagara Quality Assurance team and on an annual basis by third party auditors such as the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), FDA and the International Bottled Water Association (IBWA). Additionally, Niagara participates in regular customer audits to ensure compliance with varying customer requirements. These audits help to ensure that the company meets federal and industry standards for sanitation and process controls. For the last 10 years, all Niagara facilities have been certified as SQF Level 3 through NSF or Eurofins, which is the highest level of certification attainable. SQF level 3 certification is internationally recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI).
Production
Niagara utilizes high speed manufacturing equipment and each production line has the capability to produce 1200 bottles of water per minute. Maintaining quality at such high speeds is critical to our success. This is why Niagara utilizes state of the art technology to continuously perform visual checks during the entire production process. Visual check systems are able to recognize and reject bottles that have defects such as underfilled bottles, mis-aligned caps, improperly aligned labels and much more. The QA team also monitors several aspects of the water purification process on a daily basis to ensure that we are producing a safe and consistent product. On-site QA laboratories ensure that results are obtained quickly.
Certified Plant Operators
Our product quality and overall success depends on the knowledge and strength of our team members. All Quality Assurance team members are required to pass an internationally recognized exam on bottled water manufacturing and quality which is administered by IBWA.



With its own set of testing requirements and good manufacturing standards, the bottled water industry is one of the most highly regulated in the United States. Bottled water is regulated by the FDA which is also responsible for regulating the food and pharmaceutical industries. Tap water on the other hand is regulated by the EPA. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, FDA regulations for bottled water must be at least as stringent as the EPA’s Primary Drinking Water Standards (known as Maximum Contaminant Levels). Bottled water is generally required to be tested for the same parameters as tap water, but the standards are, in many cases, stricter than for tap water. Ensuring the safety of the water is our primary objective in providing bottled water products to our customers.    
Water Standards of Identity
Since the bottled water industry is regulated by the FDA, they have established standards of identity for several types of bottled water. This ensures that each type of bottled water meets minimum standards. The following are examples of types of bottled water on the market.  Niagara currently bottles spring water, purified water and purified water with minerals added.

Spring Water - Bottled water derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth. Spring water can only be collected at the spring or through a borehole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring. 
Purified & Distilled Water - Bottled water that has been produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis or other suitable processes while meeting the definition of purified water in the United States Pharmacopoeia. Other suitable names for bottled water treated by one of the above processes may include “distilled water” if it is produced by distillation, “deionized water” if it is produced by deionization, etc. 
Mineral Water - Bottled water containing not less than 250 parts per million total dissolved solids. Mineral water is distinguished from other types of bottled water by its constant level and relative proportions of mineral and trace elements at the point of emergence from the source. No minerals can be added to this product. 
Sparkling Bottled Water - Water that after treatment, and possible replacement with carbon dioxide, contains the same amount of carbon dioxide that it had as it emerged from the source. Sparkling bottled waters may be labeled as “sparkling drinking water”, “sparkling mineral water”, “sparkling spring water”, etc.
Artesian water/Artesian Well Water - Bottled water from a well that taps a confined aquifer (a water-bearing underground layer of rock or sand) in which the water level stands at some height above the top of the aquifer. 
Well Water - Bottled water from a hole bored, drilled or otherwise constructed in the ground which taps the water aquifer. 

Distilled, Purified, Purified with 
Minerals Added and Alkaline Water
Each bottle of water begins with a carefully selected well or municipal water source. The water is initially processed using a multi-step filtration process depending on the source.  Next, the water is purified using a reverse osmosis or distillation system and then it is disinfected with ozone just prior to bottling. 
Alkaline products are made using a similar process, however, there is an additional electrolysis step to increase the pH. Both alkaline and purified with minerals added products have one additional step, just after the water is disinfected with ozone, it is re-mineralized. We 



Providing great tasting spring water starts with finding the best tasting, highest quality source.  All spring sources must undergo an intense inspection before it is approved for use in Niagara products.  The sources are inspected by our trained and experienced Quality Assurance staff which includes microbiologists, chemists, and hydro-geologists.  During the inspection process, all aspects of the source are examined including security, treatment at the source, water chemistry, and environmental impact.  
 
Once a spring is approved for use the spring water is collected and then loaded onto dedicated water tankers and delivered to our bottling facilities.

Water is tested at our facility to assure quality and safety prior to use. It is then filtered down to 0.2 microns and disinfected with ozone just prior to bottling.  

         Spring, Distilled, Purified, Purified with Minerals Added and Alkaline Water Processing

Water Processing
1. In the spring water process, water from an approved source is transported to the bottling facility on dedicated water tankers. 
2. In order for a source to be approved, the water source analytical data and the spring site must be carefully evaluated by our QA team which includes microbiologists, chemists, and hydro-geologists. The quality assurance department frequently collects samples to monitor microbiological and chemical characteristics.
3. For all other types of bottled water, the source may be either a municipal or deep protected well which is directly connected to the bottling facility. These sites also go through a similar approval process. 
4. Depending on the source, the water will be initially processed by carbon filtration, aeration and/ or UV filtration. All water types will then pass through a 0.2 micron pharmaceutical grade filter to remove any microbiological contaminants.
5. Purified, purified with minerals, Alkaline and distilled products will then pass through multiple reverse osmosis units. These high pressure pumps and semi-permeable membranes are used to remove all remaining impurities.
6. In the distilled process, the water from the reverse osmosis units will then pass through the distiller where the evaporation and subsequent collection of water by condensation is an addition purification step. 
7. Alkaline products must go through an additional electrolysis step prior to re-mineralization. 
8. Once the water has been processed by filtration and reverse osmosis it will then be stored temporarily in storage silo ready for sanitizing and bottling. Each manufacturing facility has separate silos dedicated to each water type. 
9. All waters are sanitized by ozone. Ozone is a specialized molecule consisting of pure oxygen which is highly effective at sanitizing water. This process is continuously monitored by the Quality Assurance department. 
10. Purified water with minerals added and Alkaline products must go through an additional remineralization step that occurs just after ozone contact tank. 
11. Bottles are now ready to be filled and labeled. State of the art bottling equipment is used to bottle the finished product. Each bottle is given a unique code to identify the bottling plant, production line, time and date. 
12. Products are given one final check for quality assurance prior to shipping and retain samples are collected daily for each production run. These samples are analyzed by our internal lab to ensure adherence to company specifications and standards. Some samples are also sent out to third party labs to ensure compliance with state and federal regulatory standards.
